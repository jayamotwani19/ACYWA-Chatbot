Title: Australian Child and Youth Wellbeing Atlas

data asset that maps information on children and young people aged 0 to 24 in
communities across Australia. This enables the visualisation, analysis, and
monitoring of health and wellbeing metrics for children and young people.

This unique new data asset empowers researchers, non-government, state and federal organisations to identify priorities for child health and wellbeing research and initiatives in meaningful and cost-effective ways.
The Australian Child and Youth Wellbeing Atlas - ACYWA accelerates the national access to and use of spatial data to understand inequities and improve the wellbeing, health and development of children and young people.
By enabling equitable access to this information, the Atlas contributes to the democratisation of data, fostering a more inclusive and informed society.
The Australian Child and Youth Wellbeing Atlas defines children’s health and wellbeing in the context of the evidence-based Nest framework of child and youth wellbeing developed by the Australian Research Alliance for Children and Youth (ARACY), which includes six wellbeing domains:
Deliver a freely accessible nationwide platform featuring geospatial and temporal visualisation of comprehensive child health and wellbeing indicators at local and national levels.
Provide insights into the associations between community-level factors and children's outcomes.
Help guide the development of geographically sensitive policy, which acknowledges the relationships between the spatial patterns of children’s wellbeing outcomes, and the provision of services in an area.
Identify gaps, priorities, and research opportunities, aiding policy and investment decisions for tangible health improvements.
Expand a national network of experts in child and youth wellbeing and data monitoring, including policymakers, researchers, clinicians, and community representatives.
A partnership that breaks through system barriers:
The Australian Child and Youth Wellbeing Atlas is an exciting systemic initiative that brings together leading expertise across Australia’s child and youth research, advocacy, policy and practice fields.
The partnership has naturally evolved, driven by an exceptional motivation to collaborate and fulfill a common mission. This mission aims to revolutionise the access and utilisation of data to enhance children's health, development, and wellbeing, ultimately striving for equitable outcomes for all Australian children.

In the Atlas prototype, data has not yet been disaggregated for First Nations children and young people. This decision arises from our profound awareness of the commonly inadequate representation of wellbeing outcomes concerning First Nations children and young people.
Prior to incorporating data pertaining to First Nations children and young people, we intend to establish a robust Indigenous Data Governance structure through our Indigenous Data Sovereignty Working Group. This framework will provide guidance to ensure the accurate inclusion and meaningful application of data related to First Nations children and young people.
In the Atlas prototype, data has not been disaggregated by gender identity. It only provides a breakdown based on the traditional categories of female and male.
We are profoundly aware that many young people identify with a wide spectrum of gender-diverse identities, which go beyond the binary concept of female and male. These identities include terms such as non-binary, gender fluid, gender questioning, agender, and others that best represent their gender identity.
The process of disaggregating data by these gender identities presents several challenges. Often, existing data collection methods do not yet capture this information, and even when they do, privacy concerns may necessitate data suppression due to small sample sizes or data quality issues.
The ACYWA project is committed to working on finding ways to overcome these obstacles. Our objective is to directly engage with trans and gender-diverse youth to understand their preferences regarding how their data should be represented.
An increasing body of research into wellbeing outcomes of gender-diverse people has revealed that gender-diverse children and youth face notably more challenges across multiple aspects of wellbeing, performing comparatively worse than other vulnerable groups across specific measures.¹

Title: Trans and Gender Diverse Young People — Australian Child and Youth Wellbeing Atlas

In the Atlas prototype, data has not been disaggregated by gender identity. It only provides a breakdown based on the traditional categories of female and male.
We are profoundly aware that many young people identify with a wide spectrum of gender-diverse identities, which go beyond the binary concept of female and male. These identities include terms such as non-binary, gender fluid, gender questioning, agender, and others that best represent their gender identity.
The process of disaggregating data by these gender identities presents several challenges. Often, existing data collection methods do not yet capture this information, and even when they do, privacy concerns may necessitate data suppression due to small sample sizes or data quality issues.
The ACYWA project is committed to working on finding ways to overcome these obstacles. Our objective is to directly engage with trans and gender-diverse youth to understand their preferences regarding how their data should be represented.
An increasing body of research into wellbeing outcomes of gender-diverse people has revealed that gender-diverse children and youth face notably more challenges across multiple aspects of wellbeing, performing comparatively worse than other vulnerable groups across specific measures.¹

Title: Healthy — Australian Child and Youth Wellbeing Atlas

Indicators
Children and young people with a profound or severe core activity limitation
Children and young people with type 1 diabetes
Policy context
Disability and chronic health conditions are often inter-related. Long-term health issues and disability can both result in a functional limitation that impacts everyday life for children and young people. People with disabilities are more likely to develop long-term health conditions, and people with long-term health conditions are more likely to develop disability.¹
The most common long-term health issues for children are asthma, diabetes and cancer.²
A disability is defined as any impairment that impacts an individual’s daily tasks or ‘core activities’ (communication, self-care or mobility) and has lasted or is likely to last more than six months.³ Disability encompasses physical, intellectual, psychiatric, sensory and neurological conditions or a combination of these.³ The severity of a disability can range from mild (needs no help and has no difficulty with core activities but uses aids or has impairments in other areas) to profound (unable to do or always needs help with core activities).⁴
Around two thirds (67%) of Australian children with a disability require assistance with daily activities (e.g. communication, mobility, self-care). Many children with disabilities have learning and social difficulties at school. In addition to challenges faced by the child, disability impacts the entire family unit. The assistance and care (both formal and informal) of a child with a disability often results in parents and/or carers having reduced income, increased expenses, poorer emotional and physical wellbeing and strained relationships. Significant evidence has supported the effectiveness of early intervention for children with developmental disabilities.⁵
Across the lifespan, having a disability is associated with poorer health behaviours and adverse health outcomes.⁶ Further, disability is associated with poorer social engagement and education. These outcomes could be related directly to the disability itself or a result of limited access (due to an individual’s disability) to appropriate information, services and support that foster wellbeing. People with disabilities have higher rates of mental illness, psychological distress, arthritis, smoking and a range of other health conditions than the general population.⁷
Given the challenges and needs of children with disability and their families, understanding the proportion of children with disability in particular geographical regions can assist policy-makers and service providers in decision-making to improve outcomes.

Indicators
ED presentations by type – public hospitals
Total ED presentations – public hospitals
Policy context
Emergency department (ED) presentations data for children is an important health indicator. It aids in disease surveillance by identifying trends in paediatric health conditions and helps allocate healthcare resources. It also highlights disparities in healthcare access and can guide efforts to promote health equity.
Indicators
Number of children and young people
Policy contextThe number of children and young people is based on the Estimated Resident Population (ERP) which is a demographic statistic used to estimate the number of people living in a specific area at a given point in time. ERP takes into account factors like births, deaths, and migration (both international and interstate) to provide a more accurate picture of the population.
Indicators
Births
First antenatal visit
Infant mortality
Low birth weight
Preterm births
Smoking in pregnancy
Policy context
Health influences begin even before birth, with a mother’s own health and wellbeing playing an important role in the baby’s development in utero. A healthy start to life contributes to good health and wellbeing for a child over their lifetime.
For instance, smoking during pregnancy is one of the leading preventable causes of a wide range of adverse outcomes for babies. There is strong evidence that smoking in pregnancy is associated with low birth weight and increased risk of a child being born prematurely. There is also evidence of association with sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).¹
Early childhood development sets the trajectory for physical health and cognitive, emotional and behavioural wellbeing through childhood, adolescence and into adulthood.
Optimising a child’s chance to have a healthy and productive life requires a holistic approach which includes a safe and nurturing home and community environment, access to appropriate health and family services and early identification of risk factors and developmental issues.²ʼ³

Indicators
Hospital admissions by principal diagnosis – public hospitals
Total admissions – public hospitals
Policy context
Hospital admissions data provides a clear picture of the disease burden on children and young people, encompassing a wide range of health issues from infectious diseases to chronic conditions. These admissions are essential for public health surveillance, aiding in the identification of disease outbreaks and emerging health trends.
Moreover, hospital admissions data offers insights into healthcare quality and accessibility. Elevated admission rates may signal deficiencies in preventive care, primary healthcare, or vaccination programs, highlighting areas that require attention to reduce hospitalisation needs.
High child hospital admission rates can also reflect broader societal issues affecting children's wellbeing, such as poverty or environmental hazards, emphasising the importance of addressing underlying determinants of health.
Indicators
Chickenpox
Diphtheria
Fully immunised
Haemophilus influenza type b
Hepatitis B
Measles
Meningococcal disease
Polio
Policy context
Measuring childhood immunisation coverage helps track how protected the community is against vaccine-preventable diseases and reflects the capacity of the healthcare system to effectively target and provide vaccinations to children. Fully immunised status is measured at ages 1, 2 and 5 and means that a child has received all the scheduled vaccinations appropriate for their age.¹

Indicators
ED presentations due to injury, poisoning or other external causes
Fatally injured in a road accident
Hospital admissions due to injury or poisoning
Policy context
Injury is a leading cause of child deaths and a major cause of hospitalisation.¹ Children are vulnerable to certain types of injuries depending on their age, reflecting their stage of development. Very young children face an increased vulnerability to injuries since they lack the capacity to effectively assess risks associated with new activities and avoid potential hazards. In the case of older children, injuries are increasingly influenced not only by their physical and social environment but also by risk-taking behaviours.²
Injury death and disability can be prevented by identifying and removing the causes or reducing children’s exposure to them. Recognising the impact of injury on children, a new National Injury Prevention Strategy is being developed to reduce the risk of injury for children.³

Policy context
Good mental health is an essential component of wellbeing and means that children and young people are more likely to have fulfilling relationships, cope with adverse circumstances and adapt to change.
Poor mental health is associated with behavioural issues, a diminished sense of self-worth and a decreased ability to cope. This has adverse effects on a young person’s quality of life, emotional wellbeing and relationships as well as their capacity to engage in school and other activities.¹
The most currently available national data on child and adolescent mental health is the 2013–14 Australian Child and Adolescent Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing (also known as the Young Minds Matter survey).²
Most states and territories conduct their own surveys among school students, addressing aspects including mental health and wellbeing. However, these survey findings are typically only made available in the form of a summarised report specific to each state or territory. In some states, no public reporting takes place.

Indicators
Child mortality
Young people mortality
Policy context
The primary causes of child mortality vary between different stages of childhood.
The majority of deaths between the ages of 0 and 5 years of age occur within the first year of life, with the highest risk of death being in the first month.¹ The main causes of death between the ages of 0 and 5 years include conditions originating in the perinatal period, congenital diseases, Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, injury related to traffic accidents, drowning and accidental threats to breathing, and cancer.²
In addition to the personal consequences of the death of a child on individuals in Western Australian communities, child mortality can be used as an indicator of the health of a population due to its association with a range of social and economic factors. Child mortality is associated with social and economic disadvantage, access to health care, nutrition, hygiene, sanitation, maternal education, unemployment, community awareness of child mortality risk factors, and immunisation programs .¹ʼ³ʼ⁴
Child mortality is an important indicator for health providers and policy-makers to inform policy, strategy, and intervention, providing insight into the health of young children as well as the broader population.¹ The importance of child mortality statistics is amplified by the knowledge that many of the causes of death in this period, such as traffic accidents or accidental drowning, are preventable.¹

Indicators
Nutrition
Obesity and healthy weight
Physical activity
Policy context
Physical health is a basic building block for children and young people’s current wellbeing and future life outcomes. Being physically healthy includes being physically active, having a good diet and being in the healthy weight range.
During childhood and adolescence, children and young people form health-related attitudes and behaviours that can stay with them for life, making it a critical time to support positive and deter negative health practices.¹
Based on measured data from the 2017–18 National Health Survey, the majority of children aged 5–14 (67% or an estimated 2 million) were a normal weight and around 1 in 4 (24% or an estimated 746,000) were overweight or obese. Almost 1 in 13 (7.7%) children aged 5–14 were obese.²

Indicators
Knowledge and skills about safe sexual and reproductive health behaviours
Prevalence of sexually transmitted infections (STIs)
Policy context
Good sexual health is important for young people’s physical health and overall wellbeing. Sexual health includes not only safe sex practices to reduce the risk of sexually transmissible infections (STI) and pregnancy but also appropriate access to information and services that are inclusive and culturally safe.
STIs are most commonly contracted through unsafe sexual practices and can be either bacterial or viral and have serious long-term complications if left untreated.¹ These consequences include chronic abdominal pain, infertility and genital, heart and brain damage.¹ They are often undiagnosed as they can have no symptoms.¹
The most common STIs that are considered a health risk for young people are chlamydia, syphilis and gonorrhoea. These STIs are nationally notifiable diseases. This means state and territory health authorities supply notifications of chlamydia, gonorrhoea and syphilis to the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System to collect information relating to diseases of public importance.

Policy context
Most Australian young people engage in healthy behaviours, yet participating in risk-taking behaviour including experimentation with alcohol and other substances can be part of the transition to adulthood. Evidence suggests that the earlier young people commence consuming alcohol and other drugs, the greater the likelihood of dependency and associated problems in later life.¹
Research indicates alcohol can adversely affect brain development in adolescents and be linked to health complications and alcohol-related complications later in life.¹ Chronic health conditions linked to alcohol include heart problems, cancer and liver damage.¹ Alcohol is also a contributing factor to the three leading causes of death among adolescents – unintentional injuries, homicide and suicide.²
Illicit drug use is a major cause of preventable disease and illness in Australia overall. Aside from the considerable health and behavioural problems associated with illicit drug use, children and young people are at particular risk of harm from drug use, as it negatively impacts the development of neurological pathways and is strongly associated with long-term drug dependency issues.³
Adolescent e‐cigarette use (vaping) and its harms are public health concerns.⁴ A national survey in 2019 found that 10% of 14–17‐year‐old Australians had used e‐cigarettes.⁴ More recent studies, smaller or non‐representative, have suggested that the rate is rapidly increasing.⁴
It is imperative to address any health concerns or risky behaviours early to improve future health and wellbeing outcomes and quality of life for young people.⁵

Title: Healthy — Australian Child and Youth Wellbeing Atlas

Indicators
Children and young people with a profound or severe core activity limitation
Children and young people with type 1 diabetes
Policy context
Disability and chronic health conditions are often inter-related. Long-term health issues and disability can both result in a functional limitation that impacts everyday life for children and young people. People with disabilities are more likely to develop long-term health conditions, and people with long-term health conditions are more likely to develop disability.¹
The most common long-term health issues for children are asthma, diabetes and cancer.²
A disability is defined as any impairment that impacts an individual’s daily tasks or ‘core activities’ (communication, self-care or mobility) and has lasted or is likely to last more than six months.³ Disability encompasses physical, intellectual, psychiatric, sensory and neurological conditions or a combination of these.³ The severity of a disability can range from mild (needs no help and has no difficulty with core activities but uses aids or has impairments in other areas) to profound (unable to do or always needs help with core activities).⁴
Around two thirds (67%) of Australian children with a disability require assistance with daily activities (e.g. communication, mobility, self-care). Many children with disabilities have learning and social difficulties at school. In addition to challenges faced by the child, disability impacts the entire family unit. The assistance and care (both formal and informal) of a child with a disability often results in parents and/or carers having reduced income, increased expenses, poorer emotional and physical wellbeing and strained relationships. Significant evidence has supported the effectiveness of early intervention for children with developmental disabilities.⁵
Across the lifespan, having a disability is associated with poorer health behaviours and adverse health outcomes.⁶ Further, disability is associated with poorer social engagement and education. These outcomes could be related directly to the disability itself or a result of limited access (due to an individual’s disability) to appropriate information, services and support that foster wellbeing. People with disabilities have higher rates of mental illness, psychological distress, arthritis, smoking and a range of other health conditions than the general population.⁷
Given the challenges and needs of children with disability and their families, understanding the proportion of children with disability in particular geographical regions can assist policy-makers and service providers in decision-making to improve outcomes.

Indicators
ED presentations by type – public hospitals
Total ED presentations – public hospitals
Policy context
Emergency department (ED) presentations data for children is an important health indicator. It aids in disease surveillance by identifying trends in paediatric health conditions and helps allocate healthcare resources. It also highlights disparities in healthcare access and can guide efforts to promote health equity.
Indicators
Number of children and young people
Policy contextThe number of children and young people is based on the Estimated Resident Population (ERP) which is a demographic statistic used to estimate the number of people living in a specific area at a given point in time. ERP takes into account factors like births, deaths, and migration (both international and interstate) to provide a more accurate picture of the population.
Indicators
Births
First antenatal visit
Infant mortality
Low birth weight
Preterm births
Smoking in pregnancy
Policy context
Health influences begin even before birth, with a mother’s own health and wellbeing playing an important role in the baby’s development in utero. A healthy start to life contributes to good health and wellbeing for a child over their lifetime.
For instance, smoking during pregnancy is one of the leading preventable causes of a wide range of adverse outcomes for babies. There is strong evidence that smoking in pregnancy is associated with low birth weight and increased risk of a child being born prematurely. There is also evidence of association with sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).¹
Early childhood development sets the trajectory for physical health and cognitive, emotional and behavioural wellbeing through childhood, adolescence and into adulthood.
Optimising a child’s chance to have a healthy and productive life requires a holistic approach which includes a safe and nurturing home and community environment, access to appropriate health and family services and early identification of risk factors and developmental issues.²ʼ³

Indicators
Hospital admissions by principal diagnosis – public hospitals
Total admissions – public hospitals
Policy context
Hospital admissions data provides a clear picture of the disease burden on children and young people, encompassing a wide range of health issues from infectious diseases to chronic conditions. These admissions are essential for public health surveillance, aiding in the identification of disease outbreaks and emerging health trends.
Moreover, hospital admissions data offers insights into healthcare quality and accessibility. Elevated admission rates may signal deficiencies in preventive care, primary healthcare, or vaccination programs, highlighting areas that require attention to reduce hospitalisation needs.
High child hospital admission rates can also reflect broader societal issues affecting children's wellbeing, such as poverty or environmental hazards, emphasising the importance of addressing underlying determinants of health.
Indicators
Chickenpox
Diphtheria
Fully immunised
Haemophilus influenza type b
Hepatitis B
Measles
Meningococcal disease
Polio
Policy context
Measuring childhood immunisation coverage helps track how protected the community is against vaccine-preventable diseases and reflects the capacity of the healthcare system to effectively target and provide vaccinations to children. Fully immunised status is measured at ages 1, 2 and 5 and means that a child has received all the scheduled vaccinations appropriate for their age.¹

Indicators
ED presentations due to injury, poisoning or other external causes
Fatally injured in a road accident
Hospital admissions due to injury or poisoning
Policy context
Injury is a leading cause of child deaths and a major cause of hospitalisation.¹ Children are vulnerable to certain types of injuries depending on their age, reflecting their stage of development. Very young children face an increased vulnerability to injuries since they lack the capacity to effectively assess risks associated with new activities and avoid potential hazards. In the case of older children, injuries are increasingly influenced not only by their physical and social environment but also by risk-taking behaviours.²
Injury death and disability can be prevented by identifying and removing the causes or reducing children’s exposure to them. Recognising the impact of injury on children, a new National Injury Prevention Strategy is being developed to reduce the risk of injury for children.³

Resilience - Speaking Out Survey Western Australia

Policy context
Good mental health is an essential component of wellbeing and means that children and young people are more likely to have fulfilling relationships, cope with adverse circumstances and adapt to change.
Poor mental health is associated with behavioural issues, a diminished sense of self-worth and a decreased ability to cope. This has adverse effects on a young person’s quality of life, emotional wellbeing and relationships as well as their capacity to engage in school and other activities.¹
The most currently available national data on child and adolescent mental health is the 2013–14 Australian Child and Adolescent Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing (also known as the Young Minds Matter survey).²
Most states and territories conduct their own surveys among school students, addressing aspects including mental health and wellbeing. However, these survey findings are typically only made available in the form of a summarised report specific to each state or territory. In some states, no public reporting takes place.

Indicators
Child mortality
Young people mortality
Policy context
The primary causes of child mortality vary between different stages of childhood.
The majority of deaths between the ages of 0 and 5 years of age occur within the first year of life, with the highest risk of death being in the first month.¹ The main causes of death between the ages of 0 and 5 years include conditions originating in the perinatal period, congenital diseases, Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, injury related to traffic accidents, drowning and accidental threats to breathing, and cancer.²
In addition to the personal consequences of the death of a child on individuals in Western Australian communities, child mortality can be used as an indicator of the health of a population due to its association with a range of social and economic factors. Child mortality is associated with social and economic disadvantage, access to health care, nutrition, hygiene, sanitation, maternal education, unemployment, community awareness of child mortality risk factors, and immunisation programs .¹ʼ³ʼ⁴
Child mortality is an important indicator for health providers and policy-makers to inform policy, strategy, and intervention, providing insight into the health of young children as well as the broader population.¹ The importance of child mortality statistics is amplified by the knowledge that many of the causes of death in this period, such as traffic accidents or accidental drowning, are preventable.¹

Indicators
Nutrition
Obesity and healthy weight
Physical activity
Policy context
Physical health is a basic building block for children and young people’s current wellbeing and future life outcomes. Being physically healthy includes being physically active, having a good diet and being in the healthy weight range.
During childhood and adolescence, children and young people form health-related attitudes and behaviours that can stay with them for life, making it a critical time to support positive and deter negative health practices.¹
Based on measured data from the 2017–18 National Health Survey, the majority of children aged 5–14 (67% or an estimated 2 million) were a normal weight and around 1 in 4 (24% or an estimated 746,000) were overweight or obese. Almost 1 in 13 (7.7%) children aged 5–14 were obese.²

Indicators
Knowledge and skills about safe sexual and reproductive health behaviours
Prevalence of sexually transmitted infections (STIs)
Policy context
Good sexual health is important for young people’s physical health and overall wellbeing. Sexual health includes not only safe sex practices to reduce the risk of sexually transmissible infections (STI) and pregnancy but also appropriate access to information and services that are inclusive and culturally safe.
STIs are most commonly contracted through unsafe sexual practices and can be either bacterial or viral and have serious long-term complications if left untreated.¹ These consequences include chronic abdominal pain, infertility and genital, heart and brain damage.¹ They are often undiagnosed as they can have no symptoms.¹
The most common STIs that are considered a health risk for young people are chlamydia, syphilis and gonorrhoea. These STIs are nationally notifiable diseases. This means state and territory health authorities supply notifications of chlamydia, gonorrhoea and syphilis to the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System to collect information relating to diseases of public importance.

Policy context
Most Australian young people engage in healthy behaviours, yet participating in risk-taking behaviour including experimentation with alcohol and other substances can be part of the transition to adulthood. Evidence suggests that the earlier young people commence consuming alcohol and other drugs, the greater the likelihood of dependency and associated problems in later life.¹
Research indicates alcohol can adversely affect brain development in adolescents and be linked to health complications and alcohol-related complications later in life.¹ Chronic health conditions linked to alcohol include heart problems, cancer and liver damage.¹ Alcohol is also a contributing factor to the three leading causes of death among adolescents – unintentional injuries, homicide and suicide.²
Illicit drug use is a major cause of preventable disease and illness in Australia overall. Aside from the considerable health and behavioural problems associated with illicit drug use, children and young people are at particular risk of harm from drug use, as it negatively impacts the development of neurological pathways and is strongly associated with long-term drug dependency issues.³
Adolescent e‐cigarette use (vaping) and its harms are public health concerns.⁴ A national survey in 2019 found that 10% of 14–17‐year‐old Australians had used e‐cigarettes.⁴ More recent studies, smaller or non‐representative, have suggested that the rate is rapidly increasing.⁴
It is imperative to address any health concerns or risky behaviours early to improve future health and wellbeing outcomes and quality of life for young people.⁵

Title: Learning — Australian Child and Youth Wellbeing Atlas

Indicators
Combined domains
Communication skills and general knowledge domain
Emotional maturity domain
Language and cognition domain
Physical health and wellbeing domain
Social competence domain
Policy context
The assessment of a child’s readiness for learning involves the combined consideration of children’s socio-emotional, cognitive and behavioural strengths and vulnerabilities and the individual literacy and numeracy skills the child brings to school.
This indicator is informed by the Australian Early Development Census (AEDC), formerly the Australian Early Development Index, which is a national measure of early childhood development.
The AEDC is a population-based measure of children’s development as they enter their first year of full-time school. The assessment takes place nationally every three years. Teachers complete the Early Development Instrument for each child in their class.¹
The AEDC collects data relating to five key areas of early childhood development which are closely linked to child health, education and social outcomes. The five domains are physical health and wellbeing, social competence, emotional maturity, language and cognitive skills (school-based), and communication skills and general knowledge.
AEDC results are presented as the number and percentage of children who are developmentally on track, developmentally at risk and developmentally vulnerable in each domain.² Further, two summary indicators are presented to show the percentage of children who are developmentally vulnerable on one or more domain(s) and developmentally vulnerable on two or more domains.
References
For more information on the Australian Early Development Census refer to the Australian Early Development Census website.  Available at:https://www.aedc.gov.au/
In 2009, when the AEDC was first completed nationally, a series of cut-off scores was established for each of the five domains. Children falling below the 10th percentile were considered ‘developmentally vulnerable’, children falling between the 10th and 25th percentile were considered ‘developmentally at risk’, and all other children were considered to be ‘developmentally on track’. The cut-off scores set in 2009 provide a reference point against which AEDC results can be compared. These have remained the same across all five collection cycles.

Indicators
Attendance in early childhood education
Childcare availability
Policy context
Starting from infancy, children need nurturing, engaging, and attentive care to support their early childhood development and well-being. Childcare, which involves looking after a child by someone other than their parents or legal guardians, can take formal forms such as professional childcare providers or informal forms like grandparents, other relatives, friends, neighbours, or nannies.
Children’s participation in formal childcare, as well as early childhood education programs (such as preschool), are encompassed by the term early childhood education and care (ECEC).
In Australia, a preschool program is defined as a structured, play-based learning program, delivered by a degree-qualified teacher, aimed primarily at children in the year or two before they commence full-time schooling. Preschool programs are referred to by a variety of other terms across states and territories. Preschool age entry requirements also differ across states and territories.¹

Policy context
Since 2008, all students in Years 3, 5, 7 and 9 are tested annually using a common assessment tool under the National Assessment Program – Literacy and Numeracy (NAPLAN). Each year in May, over one million students nationally sit the NAPLAN tests. The students are assessed in the domains of reading, writing, language conventions (spelling, grammar and punctuation) and numeracy.¹
The NAPLAN national minimum standard is “the agreed minimum acceptable standard of knowledge and skills without which a student will have difficulty making sufficient progress at school”.² This tool is administered by the Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority (ACARA).

Indicators
Apparent retention rate
Highest year of school completed
Policy context
Attendance data for Years 11 and 12 are not captured as there are different pathways for students after Year 10. Apparent retention rates provide an indicative measure of the proportion of full-time school students who have stayed at school or equivalent, for a designated year and grade of education.¹
In most states and territories, students are required to remain at school or participate in an approved non-school option (such as employment or training) until the end of the year they turn 17 years and six months, or graduate from high school. Young people who remain engaged in education, training or employment following their compulsory school years have better long-term prospects in the labour market, and consequently in life.²
The Australian Bureau of Statistics records the highest level of primary or secondary schooling completed through the census. The data is used to help build a picture of the education levels attained in each area of Australia and to assist in the planning of educational facilities.³

Title: Learning — Australian Child and Youth Wellbeing Atlas

Indicators
Combined domains
Communication skills and general knowledge domain
Emotional maturity domain
Language and cognition domain
Physical health and wellbeing domain
Social competence domain
Policy context
The assessment of a child’s readiness for learning involves the combined consideration of children’s socio-emotional, cognitive and behavioural strengths and vulnerabilities and the individual literacy and numeracy skills the child brings to school.
This indicator is informed by the Australian Early Development Census (AEDC), formerly the Australian Early Development Index, which is a national measure of early childhood development.
The AEDC is a population-based measure of children’s development as they enter their first year of full-time school. The assessment takes place nationally every three years. Teachers complete the Early Development Instrument for each child in their class.¹
The AEDC collects data relating to five key areas of early childhood development which are closely linked to child health, education and social outcomes. The five domains are physical health and wellbeing, social competence, emotional maturity, language and cognitive skills (school-based), and communication skills and general knowledge.
AEDC results are presented as the number and percentage of children who are developmentally on track, developmentally at risk and developmentally vulnerable in each domain.² Further, two summary indicators are presented to show the percentage of children who are developmentally vulnerable on one or more domain(s) and developmentally vulnerable on two or more domains.
References
For more information on the Australian Early Development Census refer to the Australian Early Development Census website.  Available at:https://www.aedc.gov.au/
In 2009, when the AEDC was first completed nationally, a series of cut-off scores was established for each of the five domains. Children falling below the 10th percentile were considered ‘developmentally vulnerable’, children falling between the 10th and 25th percentile were considered ‘developmentally at risk’, and all other children were considered to be ‘developmentally on track’. The cut-off scores set in 2009 provide a reference point against which AEDC results can be compared. These have remained the same across all five collection cycles.

Indicators
Attendance in early childhood education
Childcare availability
Policy context
Starting from infancy, children need nurturing, engaging, and attentive care to support their early childhood development and well-being. Childcare, which involves looking after a child by someone other than their parents or legal guardians, can take formal forms such as professional childcare providers or informal forms like grandparents, other relatives, friends, neighbours, or nannies.
Children’s participation in formal childcare, as well as early childhood education programs (such as preschool), are encompassed by the term early childhood education and care (ECEC).
In Australia, a preschool program is defined as a structured, play-based learning program, delivered by a degree-qualified teacher, aimed primarily at children in the year or two before they commence full-time schooling. Preschool programs are referred to by a variety of other terms across states and territories. Preschool age entry requirements also differ across states and territories.¹

Indicators
Liking school – Speaking Out Survey WA
Policy context
Research suggests that a sense of belonging at school and the degree to which students report liking school has an important influence on student motivation, engagement, participation and academic outcomes.¹ʼ²
Currently, there is a lack of comprehensive national data collection to inform the indicators within this theme. Instead, most states and territories conduct their own surveys among school students, addressing aspects such as their sense of belonging in school and their engagement with teachers. However, these survey findings are typically only made available in the form of a summarised report specific to each state or territory. In some states, no public reporting takes place.

Grammar and punctuation
Numeracy
Reading
Spelling
Writing
Policy context
Since 2008, all students in Years 3, 5, 7 and 9 are tested annually using a common assessment tool under the National Assessment Program – Literacy and Numeracy (NAPLAN). Each year in May, over one million students nationally sit the NAPLAN tests. The students are assessed in the domains of reading, writing, language conventions (spelling, grammar and punctuation) and numeracy.¹
The NAPLAN national minimum standard is “the agreed minimum acceptable standard of knowledge and skills without which a student will have difficulty making sufficient progress at school”.² This tool is administered by the Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority (ACARA).

Policy context
Regular attendance and engagement in school is important for the development of intellectual and socio-emotional skills and contributes significantly to educational outcomes.
School attendance for students in Years 7 to 10 is collected annually through the data set National Student Attendance Data Collection (ACARA - administrative data). This is across all school sectors and jurisdictions in Australia.
Attendance is commonly reported through two measures, attendance level and attendance rate. The attendance level records the proportion of full-time students in Years 1-10 whose attendance rate in Semester 1 is equal to or greater than 90 per cent.¹ The attendance rate is defined as the number of actual full-time equivalent student-days attended by full-time students in Years 1-10 as a percentage of the total number of possible student-days attended over the period.²

Policy context
Research suggests that a sense of belonging at school and the degree to which students report liking school has an important influence on student motivation, engagement, participation and academic outcomes.¹ʼ²
A sense of belonging at school is derived through the school environment, positive and supportive teacher and peer relationships and personal characteristics, such as conscientiousness, optimism and self-esteem.³
Currently, there is a lack of comprehensive national data collection to inform the indicators within this theme. Instead, most states and territories conduct their own surveys among school students, addressing aspects such as their sense of belonging in school and their engagement with teachers.

Homelessness and housing instability have both immediate and longer-term effects on children and young people’s health and wellbeing. Research indicates childhood experiences of homelessness may affect physical health, educational attainment and social functioning.¹ It is also linked to homelessness in adulthood.²
Homelessness for children and young people occurs through the following pathways³:
being part of a homeless family (usually due to poverty or intergenerational homelessness)
leaving the family home with one parent (typically with the mother to escape violence or abuse)
leaving the family home independently (often to escape violence or abuse in the home)
exiting care or the youth justice system.
The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) manages the Specialist Homelessness Services Collection (SHSC) which collects data about people who are receiving support from specialist homelessness services funded by the Australian Government and State and Territory governments. This collection reports on people who are currently homeless and those at risk of homelessness and receiving homelessness support.⁴

Indicators
Unemployed and seeking full-time work
Policy context
Youth unemployment is an important wellbeing indicator as the consequences of youth unemployment are far-reaching. Poor employment outcomes, especially early in a young person’s life, negatively impact a person on both a personal and societal level. Joblessness not only results in income loss but also diminishes future job opportunities, mental wellbeing, and social inclusion, both in the short and long term. At the macroeconomic level, unemployment imposes fiscal costs on governments and also reduces tax revenue and output.¹
With regard to youth unemployment, the COVID-19 pandemic disproportionally impacted young Australians aged 15 to 24. While comprising only 14% of the workforce, they endured a significant 55% share of job losses during the lockdowns of 2021.²

Policy context
Feeling connected to community and culture is critical for children and young people as it encourages a sense of belonging, a positive sense of identity and the development of respectful and responsive relationships.¹ʼ²
Connection to community is also related to children and young people’s participation in their own lives and in the broader community. It increases their understanding of their rights and responsibilities and strengthens their interest and skills in becoming active contributors to their world.³
Children and young people should have their voices heard and be actively involved in decisions affecting their lives. Experiencing a level of autonomy and having a voice are important developmental aspects for children and young people in all areas of their life including at home, at school and in their community.

Young people doing unpaid voluntary work
Policy context
Young people’s involvement in volunteering is an important wellbeing indicator as it provides many benefits for young people such as fostering selflessness and confidence, offering diverse experiences, building connections, increasing community involvement and forming friendships.¹
Volunteering is one way for children and young people to develop their prosocial skills as it provides the opportunity to care for others, show kindness and learn to take on others' perspectives.² Recent study findings from the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children also indicate that having a positive connection to the community through volunteering can be a strong prevention against mental ill health.³

Policy context
Participation of young people in formal political processes is critical because only if all parts of society are included, the political system is representative. When young people are disengaged or disinterested in political affairs, a substantial portion of the population lacks a voice in decisions that directly impact their lives. This fundamentally undermines the representativeness of political systems.¹
To effect lasting change, it is vital for young people to actively participate in formal political processes and contribute to shaping both current and future politics. Inclusive political participation is not only a fundamental democratic right but also crucial to building stable and peaceful societies and developing policies that address the unique needs of younger generations.²

Child Protection is the prevention of, and response to, exploitation, abuse, neglect, harmful practices and violence against children. It is embedded in the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Sustainable Development Goals.¹ When children cannot live safely at home, child protection systems prioritise children’s physical, mental and psychosocial needs to safeguard their lives and futures.²
In Australia, state and territory governments are responsible for statutory child protection. Relevant departments support vulnerable children:
who have been, or are at risk of being, abused, neglected or otherwise harmed
whose parents are unable to provide adequate care or protection.³

Victims of domestic violence related assault
Victims of sexual assault
Policy context
Children can be exposed to crime as victims or witnesses within their homes or the broader community. Any type of exposure to crime at a young age can have potentially detrimental impacts on a child’s health, safety and development.
The types of crime children can be exposed to vary from non-violent crimes, such as theft or fraud, to highly violent crimes, such as aggravated sexual assault or homicide.
There can be physical and/or emotional impacts for children who are victims of, or who witness crime. In some cases, these may be short-term; however, in many cases, the consequences can involve much longer-term developmental, mental, physical and social problems.¹ For example, children exposed to crime, especially violent crime or crime involving weapons, may have:
increased likelihood of depression
suicidal ideation and behaviour
psychopathology and other psychological disorders
future victimisation and offending
homelessness.²

One parent families with children under 15 years old
Same sex parent families with dependent children
Policy context
The type of family composition or structure in which children grow up matters for their development. This is because these structures influence children’s caregiving environments, including the levels of parenting and economic resources available to or invested in them and the nature of their relationships with their caregivers.¹
Changes in family structure, regardless of their nature, have the potential to adversely affect child development. They can disrupt established family roles and routines, and potentially lead to changes in residence, parental employment, and social support networks. These changes can consequently generate stress and conflict, impacting both children and their parents/carers.²
In recent decades, Australian families have undergone significant change. The diversity of families is evident in the growth of so-called non-traditional family structures. In 2022, of the families in Australia, 14 per cent were sole parent families headed up by either a female (82.8%) or male (17.2%) parent.³ Compared with other family types, one parent families are considered to be at a higher risk of disadvantage, with respect to income, housing, employment and social participation.
Same-sex attracted parents and their children are still a small minority of Australian children and parents, however, it is likely that currently available data under-represents the total number of families, particularly sole parents.⁴

Family fighting – Speaking Out Survey Western Australia
Policy context:
Feeling safe and being safe at home is critical for children and young people’s healthy development. A safe and supportive family provides a sense of security, fosters self-esteem and responds appropriately to children and young people’s needs.¹
Children and young people who experience family violence, abuse and neglect are more likely to have poor outcomes including poor physical health, learning and developmental difficulties, higher rates of alcohol and substance abuse, mental illness, criminality, homelessness, later parenting issues and suicide.²
The causes of family and domestic violence are complex. Violence against women is linked to gender inequality reinforced through gender-based stereotypes. It is therefore critical to collect data on children and young people’s understanding of gender equality and violence against women.³

Young people under community-based supervision
Young people  in detention
Policy context
Young people who commit or allegedly commit a crime when aged 10 to 17 may be dealt with under the youth justice system. Each state and territory in Australia has its own youth justice legislation, policies and practices but the general processes by which young people are charged, and the types of legal orders available to the courts, are similar.¹
The personal, economic and social costs of not addressing the underlying causes of youth offending for both the affected young people and the wider community, are significant.²ʼ³ It is essential that coordinated early intervention and the delivery of therapeutic programs and supports to address the underlying causes of offending are implemented to divert children and young people away from the justice system.⁴

Friends – Wellbeing Engagement Collection South Australia
Policy context
Friendships play a crucial role in the lives of all children and young people, aiding in their development of communication, cooperation, social skills and independence. These bonds are particularly important during adolescence, where they can act as a protective shield against bullying and mental health issues, and contribute to the cultivation of persistence and motivation in school.¹ʼ² At the same time, the attitudes of friends can also have negative influences on a range of behavioural, social-emotional and school outcomes.³
WA research with both primary and secondary school children has demonstrated that good friendships are one of the key indicators of children’s happiness and one of the most important things for young people in their lives.⁴

Experiences of violence – Speaking Out Survey WA
Feeling safe in the community – Speaking Out Survey WA
Safe community environments – Growing Up in Queensland
Policy context
Experiencing a sense of safety and security is a critical foundation for children and young people’s healthy development. Feeling safe in their neighbourhood and other communities or groups is essential for young people to develop their independence, engage in physical activity outside their home and build positive relationships with other adults and peers.¹
Children and young people who are exposed to violence in their community are at higher risk of negative long-term outcomes including anxiety-related disorders, substance abuse and exhibiting future violent behaviour.²ʼ³
Exposure to violence in the community can also contribute to problems forming positive and trusting relationships and is strongly associated with young people exhibiting conduct problems.⁴
Currently, there is a lack of comprehensive national data collection to inform the indicators within this theme. Instead, some states and territories conduct their own surveys among school students, addressing aspects such as feeling safe in their community and experiences of physical bullying or violence. However, these survey findings are typically only made available in the form of a summarised report specific to each state or territory. In some states, no public reporting takes place.

Turning to others for support – Speaking Out Survey WA
Turning to others for support – Growing Up in Queensland
Policy context
All children and young persons are entitled to be loved and to feel secure and nurtured within positive and wholesome relationships. When young individuals receive support from such safe and positive relationships, they are more likely to maintain good mental health, exhibit resilience, be able to learn and sustain healthy relationships throughout their lives.
Between the ages of 12 and 17, young people undergo a multitude of physical, cognitive, and emotional transformations inherent to adolescence. Establishing positive relationships with family, friends, and other adults becomes vital during this phase to offer the necessary support.
Research suggests that positive relationships with non-parental adults support young people’s wellbeing by providing them with a sense of value, purpose, identity and attachment to their community.¹ Conversely, negative relationships or experiences (such as discrimination, being treated unfairly or badly) with other adults can foster a sense of worthlessness, powerlessness and negative self-concept.²

Young people under community-based supervision
Young people  in detention
Policy context
Young people who commit or allegedly commit a crime when aged 10 to 17 may be dealt with under the youth justice system. Each state and territory in Australia has its own youth justice legislation, policies and practices but the general processes by which young people are charged, and the types of legal orders available to the courts, are similar.¹
The personal, economic and social costs of not addressing the underlying causes of youth offending for both the affected young people and the wider community, are significant.²ʼ³ It is essential that coordinated early intervention and the delivery of therapeutic programs and supports to address the underlying causes of offending are implemented to divert children and young people away from the justice system.⁴

Friends – Wellbeing Engagement Collection South Australia
Policy context
Friendships play a crucial role in the lives of all children and young people, aiding in their development of communication, cooperation, social skills and independence. These bonds are particularly important during adolescence, where they can act as a protective shield against bullying and mental health issues, and contribute to the cultivation of persistence and motivation in school.¹ʼ² At the same time, the attitudes of friends can also have negative influences on a range of behavioural, social-emotional and school outcomes.³
WA research with both primary and secondary school children has demonstrated that good friendships are one of the key indicators of children’s happiness and one of the most important things for young people in their lives.⁴

Experiences of violence – Speaking Out Survey WA
Feeling safe in the community – Speaking Out Survey WA
Safe community environments – Growing Up in Queensland
Policy context
Experiencing a sense of safety and security is a critical foundation for children and young people’s healthy development. Feeling safe in their neighbourhood and other communities or groups is essential for young people to develop their independence, engage in physical activity outside their home and build positive relationships with other adults and peers.¹
Children and young people who are exposed to violence in their community are at higher risk of negative long-term outcomes including anxiety-related disorders, substance abuse and exhibiting future violent behaviour.²ʼ³
Exposure to violence in the community can also contribute to problems forming positive and trusting relationships and is strongly associated with young people exhibiting conduct problems.⁴
Currently, there is a lack of comprehensive national data collection to inform the indicators within this theme. Instead, some states and territories conduct their own surveys among school students, addressing aspects such as feeling safe in their community and experiences of physical bullying or violence. However, these survey findings are typically only made available in the form of a summarised report specific to each state or territory. In some states, no public reporting takes place.

Turning to others for support – Speaking Out Survey WA
Turning to others for support – Growing Up in Queensland
Policy context
All children and young persons are entitled to be loved and to feel secure and nurtured within positive and wholesome relationships. When young individuals receive support from such safe and positive relationships, they are more likely to maintain good mental health, exhibit resilience, be able to learn and sustain healthy relationships throughout their lives.
Between the ages of 12 and 17, young people undergo a multitude of physical, cognitive, and emotional transformations inherent to adolescence. Establishing positive relationships with family, friends, and other adults becomes vital during this phase to offer the necessary support.
Research suggests that positive relationships with non-parental adults support young people’s wellbeing by providing them with a sense of value, purpose, identity and attachment to their community.¹ Conversely, negative relationships or experiences (such as discrimination, being treated unfairly or badly) with other adults can foster a sense of worthlessness, powerlessness and negative self-concept.²

Title: Statistical areas — Australian Child and Youth Wellbeing Atlas

SA2 presented in the Australian Child and Youth Wellbeing Atlas are based onthe Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS): Volume 1 - Main Structure and Greater Capital City Statistical Areas, July 2016
Statistical Areas Level 2 (SA2) are medium-sized geographical areas that represent communities that interacts together socially and economically. The SA2 is the smallest area at which Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) non-Census and Intercensal statistics can be released.
SA2s have an average population of about 10,000 persons (range 3,000 to 25,000 persons). SA2s in remote and regional areas generally have smaller populations than those in urban areas.
Where possible, SA2s are designed around whole suburbs or rural localities. In regional and remote areas, areas with smaller populations may be combined to form one SA2. In the major cities, SA2s often represent single suburbs.
In large urban areas, SA2s are named for the gazetted suburbs that comprise them:
where a SA2 is made from a single suburb, it will retain the name of the suburb (e.g., Ellenbrook)
where a single large suburb is split into more than one SA2, it will retain the name of the suburb and a geographic identifier (e.g., Canning Vale – East)
where a SA2 is made up from 2 or 3 suburbs, then the SA2 name is a concatenation of the suburb names (e.g., Midland-Guildford)
where a SA2 is made up of 4 or more suburbs it will be named for the larger or more prominent suburbs, or given a local identifier (e.g., Gingin-Dandaragan)
See theABS website for more information on SA2s.
The Statistical Areas 3 (SA3) presented in the Child Development Atlas are based onthe Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS): Volume 1 - Main Structure and Greater Capital City Statistical Areas, July 2016.
Statistical Areas Level 3 (SA3) are geographical areas that are made up of neighbouring Statistical Areas Level 2 (SA2).
SA3s generally have a population of between 30,000 and 130,000 people. They often closely align to Local Government Areas. In outer regional and remote areas, SA3s represent areas which are widely recognised as having a distinct identity and similar social and economic characteristics.
SA3s are named according to the areas they represent:
where a SA3 represents a well-known regional area it is named after that region (e.g., Goldfields)
where a SA3 represents the functional area of a regional city it is named after that city (e.g., Bunbury)
where a SA3 represents an economic hub within a major city it is generally named to reflect that hub (e.g., Wanneroo)
where a SA3 represents a group of related suburbs it is named after one or more of those suburbs that reflect its location and extent (e.g., Belmont-Victoria Park)
See theABS website for more information on SA3s.
The Statistical Areas 4 (SA4) presented in the Australian Child and Youth Wellbeing Atlas are based onthe Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS): Volume 1 - Main Structure and Greater Capital City Statistical Areas, July 2016.
Statistical Areas 4 (SA4) are geographical areas that are made up of neighbouring Statistical Areas Level 3 (SA3s).
SA4s generally have a population of between 100,000 and 500,000. In regional areas, SA4s tend to have populations closer to the minimum (100,000 - 300,000). In metropolitan areas, the SA4s tend to have larger populations (300,000 - 500,000). There are 107 SA4 regions covering the whole of Australia without gaps or overlaps.
SA4s are named according to the areas they represent:
where a SA4 represents a labour market of a major city it is named after that city (e.g., Bendigo)
where a SA4 represents an employment centre within a larger city it is generally named to reflect both the larger city and the employment centre or part of the city that it represents (e.g., Melbourne - Inner South; Sydney – Blacktown)
where a SA4 represents a collection of labour markets in regional areas it is named using either a description of that part of the State and Territory or after one or more well-known regional areas that it closely replicates (e.g., Latrobe – Gippsland)
where this name does not identify it within Australia, it is generally preceded by the State and Territory name (e.g., Western Australia - Wheat Belt; Queensland – Outback)
The Other Territories of Jervis Bay, Cocos (Keeling) Islands, Christmas Island and Norfolk Island are together represented by a single SA4 in the 2016 ASGS.
Seethe ABS website for more information on SA4s.
The Local Government Areas used in the Australian Child and Youth Wellbeing Atlas are based onthe Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS): Volume 3 - Non ABS Structures, June 2020.
Local Government Areas (LGAs) are an ABS approximation of officially gazetted LGAs as defined by State and Local Government departments. LGAs cover incorporated areas of Australia, which are geographical areas that are the responsibility of incorporated local governing bodies.

Title: Visualisation — Australian Child and Youth Wellbeing Atlas

Visualising wellbeing data
The wellbeing data in each statistical area is displayed alongside results for all Australian areas using different colours. Depending on the dataset selected in the atlas, the score or measure can fall in a low, average, high, or in-between position on the national scale. Areas with results on the lower end of the scale are represented in shades of blue/green, those with results in or near the middle in shades of yellow/orange, and areas with results on the higher end of the scale are represented in orange/red/pink. Whether a high or low position on the scale is a good wellbeing outcome depends on the individual dataset or indicator.
For example, a low number of low birthweight babies is a good outcome (represented in blue/green) while a high percentage of children fully vaccinated is also a good outcome (represented in orange/red/pink).
The map of Australia can be zoomed in and out, similar to Google Maps.
For some indicators, the Atlas can switch between male only, female only, or all.
In this prototype, comparisons can be made between areas for one wellbeing dataset or indicator. Future development aims to include the capability to compare multiple indicators within one area and between areas.
Australia is a very large country, and the national map is dominated by geographically large, sparsely populated rural areas. However, most of the population live in the capital cities. Because of the scale of the national map, it is difficult to see details of geographical differences within those densely populated capital cities. To overcome this, zoom into an area to see more detailed results.
Future development of the Atlas aims to include the capability to produce community overviews and regional summary plots.

Title: CDA Technical information — Australian Child and Youth Wellbeing Atlas

We use administrative, census, and survey data mapped at different levels of geography to provide insights into child development across communities.
Statistical Areas 2:
The Statistical Areas 2 (SA2) presented in the Child Development Atlas are based on theAustralian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) Edition 3- Main Structure and Greater Capital City Statistical Areas, July 2021
Statistical Areas Level 2 (SA2s) are medium-sized general-purpose areas built up from whole Statistical Areas Level 1 (SA1s).
Their purpose is to represent a community that interacts together socially and economically. SA2s generally have a population between 3,000 and 25,000 with an average of about 10,000 people.
SA2s in remote and regional areas generally have smaller populations than those in urban areas.
SA2s are generally the smallest areas used for the release of ABS non-Census of Population and Housing statistics, including Estimated Resident Population and Health and Vitals data.
Whole SA2s aggregate to form Statistical Areas Level 3 (SA3s). SA2s are also used to build Significant Urban Areas and to approximate Tourism Regions.
See the ABS website for more information on SA2s.
Statistical Areas 3:
The Statistical Areas 3 (SA3) presented in the Child Development Atlas are based onthe Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) Edition 3 - Main Structure and Greater Capital City Statistical Areas, July 2021
Statistical Areas Level 3 (SA3s) are geographic areas built from whole Statistical Areas Level 2 (SA2s).
SA3s are designed for the output of regional data, including 2021 Census of Population and Housing data.
SA3s create a standard framework for the analysis of ABS data at the regional level through clustering groups of SA2s that have similar regional characteristics.
In general, SA3s are designed to have populations between 30,000 and 130,000 people. However, the creation of meaningful regional areas takes priority over population criteria. As a result, there are some SA3s with populations above 130,000 or below 30,000. Whole SA3s aggregate to form Statistical Areas Level 4 (SA4s).
See the ABS website for more information on SA3s.
Local Government Areas:
The Local Government Areas used in the Child Development Atlas are based onthe Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) Edition 3 – Non ABS Structures, July 2021.
LGAs are an ABS approximation of officially gazetted LGAs as defined by State and Local Government departments.
LGAs cover incorporated areas of Australia, which are geographical areas that are the responsibility of incorporated local governing bodies.
See the ABS website for more information on LGAs.
Health Regions:
Health Regions are defined by the Department of Health of Western Australia and consist of the state of Western Australia divided into 10 areas:
East Metro
Goldfields
Great Southern
Kimberley
Midwest
North Metro
Pilbara
South Metro
South West
Wheatbelt
Theboundary mapoutlining the Western Australian metropolitan health regions are aggregated from the Australian Bureau of Statistics Australian Statistical Geography Standard Statistical Area Level 2 geographical boundaries.
Regional Development Commission Areas:
The Regional Development Commission Areas dataset contains boundaries representing regions in Western Australia. These regions were established to support the Regional Development Commissions Act 1993, which defined their extents and established Regional Development Commissions to promote their economic development.
This dataset was updated in April 2021 to reflect change of the Shire of Wiluna from the Mid-West to the Goldfields.
The boundaries used in the Child Development Atlas contain an additional area called ‘Perth Metro’. This region comprises of the remaining Local Government Areas within the Perth Metropolitan area not already assigned to an RDC.
More information on this dataset can be found on theData WA website.
Our comprehensive maps cover indicators of learning, wellbeing, social, and developmental outcomes for children and young people in Western Australia.
These include:
Data sources and measures
Rates
Age groupings
Standardised ratios

Population data:
Where populations (denominators) cannot be ascertained from the data, estimates are obtained from ABS Censuses for computing population-level indicators, and in some instances, for numerators (e.g., births and deaths).
The Australian Census is carried out every five years, with the most recent performed in 2016.
Administrative data:
Administrative data are routinely collected data that are captured whenever an individual comes into contact with a government agency or service. These data can be de-identified and made available for research purposes.
There are some limitations that should be considered when interpreting indicators based on this data.
Firstly, indicators derived from administrative data will be restricted to the individuals who made contact with the agency/service, and so may not be representative of the general population. For example, individuals presenting to hospitals for treatment could be those with more severe disease or come from more disadvantaged population groups who are more likely to access hospitals for treatment (e.g., due to issues of affordability and access to primary care).
Reliance on administrative data also means that a section of the population who have a certain condition will not be captured (e.g., those treated in the community or in the home).
Secondly, administrative data generally do not capture information about mediating or moderating mechanisms, such as social support networks, severity of illness, or cultural practices. Such variables can influence the incidence of a particular outcome and/or the likelihood of an individual making contact with a service.
Many indicators derived from administrative data should therefore be viewed as underestimates of the true population incidence.
Lastly, there are limitations associated with parent-level indicators. Parent-child links are obtained fromthe Western Australian Family Connections Genealogy System, which uses information from birth registrations to pair children with parents. As such, only biological family connections can be made – no information is included on divorce, adoptions, stepfamilies, grand-families, or other care arrangements.
Family connections links can also not be made for individuals born outside of Western Australia, and for individuals who have missing paternity information on their birth registration record.
Summary measures of population health:
Measures of event or disease frequency represented by indicators used in the Child Development Atlas are summarisedhere.
Crude rates:
All indicators included in the Child Development Atlas are at the population level, therefore the assumption is that everyone is at risk for the whole of the year (or years) of interest, as opposed to person-time at risk.
Therefore, an event rate is calculated by dividing the total number of new cases of an event in a specified period (usually one year) by the average number of people in the population during the same period. This is then usually multiplied by 10,000 and presented as a rate per 10,000 people per year.
Depending on the data source, population denominators are calculated as the average of the size of the population at the start and at the end of the period of interest or estimated from Census data.
These basic rates are called ‘crude’ rates because they describe the overall incidence in a population without taking any other features of the population into account (e.g., age structures).
Age-specific rates:
A crude comparison may have little meaning if the groups that are being compared have very different age structures. A way to get around this problem is to calculate separate rates for different age groups (age-specific rates).
The rate in a particular age group can then be compared between geographic areas. This process can be extended to calculate separate rates for other groups, for instance male and female (sex-specific rates), and for different racial or socioeconomic groups.
Standardised rates:
Comparisons between rates may become difficult if age-specific rates are presented for a large number of different age-groups.
An alternative is to summarise or combine these age-specific rates using the process of direct standardisation.
This involves calculating the overall incidence or mortality rate that would be expected in a ‘standard’ population (i.e. population with a hypothetical age structure) if it had the same age-specific rates as the study population.
Direct standardisation requires:
The age-specific event rates in the study population and
The age distribution of the standard population
When the population being studied are not known but the total number of events is known, then the indirect standardisation is commonly used.
The indirect method is also often used for small populations where fluctuations in age-specific rates can affect the reliability of rates calculated using the direct method.
There are many similarities as well as differences between the two methods. However, the two methods will yield comparable results in most cases. It could be argued that the choice of a standard population is more important than the choice of the direct or indirect method.
The standard population used in the Child Development Atlas for purposes of indicator comparisons is the Western Australian population.
Where the data allows, the direct method of age-standardisation is the method chosen for use in the Child Development Atlas because of its advantages over the indirect method when comparing Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal mortality rates, disease incidence and prevalence rates over time.
Also note that indirect standardisation fixes the quantity of interest (i.e. age-specific rates) as the standard, and then compares the effect of differences in age-structure in two or more populations. For this reason, it is less useful as a public health comparator than direct standardisation.
Formula¹:
Direct method:
SR= (SUM (rᵢ * Pᵢ))/SUM Pᵢ
Indirect method:
SR=(C/SUM(Rᵢ *pᵢ))*R
Where:
SRis the age-standardised rate for the population being studied
rᵢis the age-group specific rate for age group i in the population being studied
Pᵢis the population of age group i in the standard population
Cis the observed number of events* in the population being studied
SUM(Rᵢpᵢ)is the expected number of events in the population being studied
Rᵢis the age-group specific rate for age group i  in the standard population
pᵢis the population for age group i in the population being studied
Ris the crude rate in the standard population
* 'Events' can include deaths, incident or prevalent cases of disease or other conditions, or health care utilisation occurrences.
Prior moving averages:
A prior moving average (PMA) is defined as the average of the span of series values preceding the current value.
The span is the number of preceding series values used to compute the average.
Click here to view the PMA Formula
A 3-year prior moving average combines a sequence of 3 years of data prior to, and including, the selected year. Similarly, a 5 year prior moving average combines a sequence of 5 years of data prior to, and including, the selected year.
Series based on prior moving averages are presented as overlapping sequences until the most recent year is included. Moving averages make it possible to combine more years of data to maximize sample size at each point while maintaining data confidentiality.
As there is little difference in the resulting rate ratios and rate differences using five or ten year age-groupings, we follow the usual convention of using five year age-groupings in the calculation of directly age-standardised rates. However, if the distribution of the data across age-groups requires collapsing of age-groups to overcome small numbers, then 10 year age-groupings may be used.
Also, due to little or no difference in rate differences produced using 0-4 compared to using <1 and 1-4 age groups in the estimation of age-standardised rates, we follow the usual practice of using the 0-4 age group as the youngest age group in the calculation of age-standardised rates.
This only applies to the calculation of age-standardised rates, and does not preclude presenting age-specific rates and distribution of events (e.g. deaths) for <1 and 1-4 age groups).
If these age groups are not used, the actual age groups are detailed in notes accompanying the age standardised population rate information.
Standardised rates are generally multiplied by 1,000 or 100,000 to avoid small decimal fractions. They are then called standardised rates per 1,000 or 100,000 population.
The indirect method is also used to calculate standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) and other standardised ratios, for example for health service utilisation and other events.
These ratios express the overall experience of a comparison population in terms of the standard population by calculating the ratio of observed to expected deaths in the comparison population. This is calculated by dividing the observed number of deaths by the expected number.
Sometimes the SMR is multiplied by 100 to express the ratio as a percentage, although this is not universally accepted. Not multiplying by 100 has the benefit of being able to say that the SMR was, for example, 2.3 times that expected rather than 130% higher.
All data presented in the Child Development Atlas are not based on specific information about individuals but relate to the number of events (or deaths) in a population relative to the size of that population (often an estimate from the ABS census).
When comparing the strength of the relation between indicators, caution should therefore be made when trying to relate the occurrence of an event to potential causes.
For example, there may be a statistical association between two indicators in the Child Development Atlas, which may lead to an assumption of a real association.
However, there should be consideration of other possibilities that may be the cause of such associations, such as chance, bias or confounding. Three important ‘alternative explanations’ for associations are:
chance (random error)
bias (systematic error) and
confounding
Random error:
Random error is the divergence, by chance alone, of a measurement from the true value.
There are three main sources of random error: biological variation (natural variation of measurement depending on an individual’s biology), measurement error (imprecision inherent in the measuring system being used), and sampling error (selection of sample from whole population).
It is impossible to completely remove random error that has resulted from chance. Therefore, when examining an association between two indicators in the CDA, it is important to consider how likely it is to be a real effect, or whether it could have arisen by chance. Whilst associations between indicators should not be ignored, any interpretations of these relationships taken on its own should be cautious, and acknowledgement should be made of the possibility that it could just reflect the effect of chance.
Bias:
Many potential sources of bias have been identified in epidemiological studies, but all fall into two main areas: bias with respect to who gets into the study (selection bias) and bias with respect to the information we collect from, or on, these people about their exposures and their diseases (measurement, information or observation bias).
Bias, also known as systematic error, is potentially more problematic than random error because it’s much harder to know what effect it might have on an outcome.
The most common systematic errors with administrative data involve underreporting of activity for a specific population, inaccurate re-coding of spatial information, or differences in data entry protocols.⁴
Confounding:
Confounding is where an apparent relationship between an exposure and an outcome is really due, in whole or in part, to a third factor that is associated with both the exposure and the outcome of interest.
Confounding is a mixing of effects because the effect of the exposure we might be interested in is mixed up with the effect of some other factor. Age, sex and socioeconomic status (SES) are common confounders.

This only applies to the calculation of age-standardised rates, and does not preclude presenting age-specific rates and distribution of events (e.g. deaths) for <1 and 1-4 age groups).
If these age groups are not used, the actual age groups are detailed in notes accompanying the age standardised population rate information.
Standardised rates are generally multiplied by 1,000 or 100,000 to avoid small decimal fractions. They are then called standardised rates per 1,000 or 100,000 population.
The indirect method is also used to calculate standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) and other standardised ratios, for example for health service utilisation and other events.
These ratios express the overall experience of a comparison population in terms of the standard population by calculating the ratio of observed to expected deaths in the comparison population. This is calculated by dividing the observed number of deaths by the expected number.
Sometimes the SMR is multiplied by 100 to express the ratio as a percentage, although this is not universally accepted. Not multiplying by 100 has the benefit of being able to say that the SMR was, for example, 2.3 times that expected rather than 130% higher.
All data presented in the Child Development Atlas are not based on specific information about individuals but relate to the number of events (or deaths) in a population relative to the size of that population (often an estimate from the ABS census).
When comparing the strength of the relation between indicators, caution should therefore be made when trying to relate the occurrence of an event to potential causes.
For example, there may be a statistical association between two indicators in the Child Development Atlas, which may lead to an assumption of a real association.
However, there should be consideration of other possibilities that may be the cause of such associations, such as chance, bias or confounding. Three important ‘alternative explanations’ for associations are:
chance (random error)
bias (systematic error) and
confounding
Random error:
Random error is the divergence, by chance alone, of a measurement from the true value.
There are three main sources of random error: biological variation (natural variation of measurement depending on an individual’s biology), measurement error (imprecision inherent in the measuring system being used), and sampling error (selection of sample from whole population).
It is impossible to completely remove random error that has resulted from chance. Therefore, when examining an association between two indicators in the CDA, it is important to consider how likely it is to be a real effect, or whether it could have arisen by chance. Whilst associations between indicators should not be ignored, any interpretations of these relationships taken on its own should be cautious, and acknowledgement should be made of the possibility that it could just reflect the effect of chance.
Bias:
Many potential sources of bias have been identified in epidemiological studies, but all fall into two main areas: bias with respect to who gets into the study (selection bias) and bias with respect to the information we collect from, or on, these people about their exposures and their diseases (measurement, information or observation bias).
Bias, also known as systematic error, is potentially more problematic than random error because it’s much harder to know what effect it might have on an outcome.
The most common systematic errors with administrative data involve underreporting of activity for a specific population, inaccurate re-coding of spatial information, or differences in data entry protocols.⁴
Confounding:
Confounding is where an apparent relationship between an exposure and an outcome is really due, in whole or in part, to a third factor that is associated with both the exposure and the outcome of interest.
Confounding is a mixing of effects because the effect of the exposure we might be interested in is mixed up with the effect of some other factor. Age, sex and socioeconomic status (SES) are common confounders.

Title: Pregnancy and Births — Australian Child and Youth Wellbeing Atlas

Indicator:
Low birth weight, born alive < 2500g
Policy context:
Infants are considered low birthweight if they are born weighing less than 2,500 grams1. This can be related to birth before 37 weeks of completed gestation (preterm low birthweight), growth restriction in the uterus (low birthweight for gestational age) or a combination of both.¹ʼ² Low birthweight is associated with increased risk of poor health, disability and death in infancy and, increased risk of health problems later in life.¹ʼ²ʼ³ It can therefore be used as an indicator of the health of infants at birth and understood as a determinant of their ongoing wellbeing.²
The likelihood of an infant being born low birthweight because of preterm birth is increased by multiple birth (twins and higher), maternal Indigenous status, maternal smoking during pregnancy, maternal residence in remote area and maternal age (under 20 or over 40)²ʼ⁴.
On an individual level, low birthweight is a risk factor for physical and neurological disabilities and increased vulnerability to illness and disease throughout the lifespan.²
Since low birthweight is associated with a range or maternal and infant health factors it can be used to evaluate and improve pre and postnatal care for mothers and babies.¹ʼ²

Indicator:
Births to mothers aged 15-19
Policy context:
Mothers aged under 20 years are classified as teenage mothers.¹ There are a range of risk factors associated with a maternal age under 20, for both mother and baby.¹
Young mothers are at a higher risk of social stigma and are more likely to experience barriers to engagement in education and employment.¹ʼ² They are also more likely to live in areas with low socioeconomic status, as well as in remote or regional areas.¹ʼ³ Teenage mothers tend to have higher rates of smoking during pregnancy and diabetes.¹ʼ³ Further, the stigma and disadvantage associated with being a young mother can exacerbate the typical challenges associated with motherhood.²
The higher incidence of disadvantage and social stigma experienced by mothers of this age group is associated with a range of negative health consequences for both mother and baby.¹ʼ²ʼ³ Babies born to teenage mothers are at an increased risk of morbidity and mortality.¹ They are more likely to be born pre-term and low birthweight for gestational age and to have poorer ongoing emotional, behavioural and cognitive outcomes than their peers.¹
Though not all teenage pregnancies are unintended, many are in Australia.³ Therefore, rates of teenage pregnancy are also related to sexual education and contraceptive use.³
The combination of these factors means that understanding teenage pregnancy rates by region has important implications for policy in a range of fields including clinical care, health promotion and education.²ʼ³ For example, prior policy recommendations regarding supporting teenage mothers and preventing unintended pregnancies include providing sufficient health education, reducing stigma and, ensuring non-judgemental and appropriate antenatal and postnatal care is accessible to young mothers.²ʼ³

Title: Physical Health — Australian Child and Youth Wellbeing Atlas

Indicator:
Chronic conditions (grouped, not by diagnosis)
Policy context:
Chronic diseases are conditions with persistent effects that usually have complex causality, a long developmental period, a prolonged course and result in functional impairment or disability.¹ Examples of chronic diseases are diabetes, cardiovascular conditions and respiratory diseases. Chronic diseases currently pose the greatest burden of ill health in Australia having a significant personal and community burden as well as substantial economic costs (healthcare expenses and reduced productivity).¹
Having a chronic condition in childhood threatens the trajectory of typical development and is associated with increased risk of disability, hospitalisation, premature mortality and psychological problems as well as poorer physical and psychosocial outcomes in adulthood.²⁻⁵
Notably, the limitations that chronic illness places on development (e.g. cognitive limitations, social limitations and emotional distress) can impact a child’s school readiness which affects their academic achievement and therefore has ramifications for long term health and wellbeing.³ There is evidence that the way chronic illnesses impact the social and emotional development and academic achievement of children is shared across the range of conditions and their severities.³ʼ⁶
Identifying the incidence of chronic diseases geographically can inform policy that aims to improve the health outcomes of children in the state for the lifespan.¹⁻³

Indicator:
Disability related hospitalisations for selected age group (grouped, not by diagnosis)
Policy context:
A disability is defined as any impairment that impacts an individuals’ daily tasks or ‘core activities’ (communication, self-care or mobility) and has lasted, or is likely to last, more than 6 months.¹ Disability encompasses physical, intellectual, psychiatric, sensory and neurological conditions or a combination of these.² The severity of a disability can range from mild (needs no help and has no difficulty with core activities but uses aids or has impairments in other areas) to profound (unable to do or always needs help with core activities)1. In 2012, 7% of children aged 0-17 in Australia were experiencing disability.³
Around two thirds (67%) of Australian children with a disability require assistance with daily activities (e.g. communication, mobility, self-care). Many children with disabilities have learning and social difficulties at school.⁴ In addition to challenges faced by the child, disability impacts the entire family unit. The assistance and care (both formal and informal) of a child with disability often results in parents and/or carers having reduced income, increased expenses, poorer emotional and physical wellbeing and strained relationships.⁴ Significant evidence has supported the effectiveness of early intervention for children with developmental disabilities.⁴
Across the life span, having a disability is associated with poorer health behaviours and adverse health outcomes5. Further, disability is associated with poorer social engagement and education. These outcomes could be related directly to the disability itself or a result of limited access (due to an individual’s disability) to appropriate information, services and support that foster wellbeing. People with disability have higher rates of mental illness, psychological distress, arthritis, smoking and a range of other health conditions than the general population.⁵
Given the challenges and needs of children with disability and their families, understanding the proportion of children with disability in particular geographical regions can assist policy makers and service providers in decision making to improve outcomes.

Alcohol and other drug related injury hospitalisations for selected age group
Policy context:
Alcohol, tobacco and cannabis are the substances most frequently used by young people.¹ Common alcohol and drug related health problems experienced by young people are road traffic injuries, assault, depression and self-harm, brain damage, overdose and blood borne disease (e.g. hepatitis C).² These adverse health outcomes or injuries place a burden on communities and the health system. Young males have significantly higher rates of alcohol and drug use and related injuries than females.³
In addition to the initial injury or problem, young people admitted to hospital for alcohol or other drug related injuries also have higher suicide risk than their peers.⁴ Further, though not all alcohol and drug related injuries are experienced by people with a substance use disorder, it is reasonable to assume that a substantial portion are. Thus, it is relevant to note that substance use disorders are among the most common mental health disorders experienced by young people in Australia and the fourth highest contributor to the burden of disease in this age group.⁴ʼ⁵
There is evidence that substance abuse can be reduced by addressing relevant risk factors such as early exposure to a substance or poor mental health, and by increasing protective factors such as early patterns of healthy behaviours.⁷ʼ⁸ Being able to understand pattern injury related to drug and alcohol use according to geographical area therefore has the advantage of allowing policy makers and service providers to make informed choices about targeted interventions to improve outcomes. Using this data alongside other social information (such as unemployment and income) could be especially important as a range of social factors are risk factors associated with alcohol and drug abuse.⁸

Title: Physical Health — Australian Child and Youth Wellbeing Atlas

Indicator:
Chronic conditions (grouped, not by diagnosis)
Policy context:
Chronic diseases are conditions with persistent effects that usually have complex causality, a long developmental period, a prolonged course and result in functional impairment or disability.¹ Examples of chronic diseases are diabetes, cardiovascular conditions and respiratory diseases. Chronic diseases currently pose the greatest burden of ill health in Australia having a significant personal and community burden as well as substantial economic costs (healthcare expenses and reduced productivity).¹
Having a chronic condition in childhood threatens the trajectory of typical development and is associated with increased risk of disability, hospitalisation, premature mortality and psychological problems as well as poorer physical and psychosocial outcomes in adulthood.²⁻⁵
Notably, the limitations that chronic illness places on development (e.g. cognitive limitations, social limitations and emotional distress) can impact a child’s school readiness which affects their academic achievement and therefore has ramifications for long term health and wellbeing.³ There is evidence that the way chronic illnesses impact the social and emotional development and academic achievement of children is shared across the range of conditions and their severities.³ʼ⁶
Identifying the incidence of chronic diseases geographically can inform policy that aims to improve the health outcomes of children in the state for the lifespan.¹⁻³

Disability related hospitalisations for selected age group (grouped, not by diagnosis)
Policy context:
A disability is defined as any impairment that impacts an individuals’ daily tasks or ‘core activities’ (communication, self-care or mobility) and has lasted, or is likely to last, more than 6 months.¹ Disability encompasses physical, intellectual, psychiatric, sensory and neurological conditions or a combination of these.² The severity of a disability can range from mild (needs no help and has no difficulty with core activities but uses aids or has impairments in other areas) to profound (unable to do or always needs help with core activities)1. In 2012, 7% of children aged 0-17 in Australia were experiencing disability.³
Around two thirds (67%) of Australian children with a disability require assistance with daily activities (e.g. communication, mobility, self-care). Many children with disabilities have learning and social difficulties at school.⁴ In addition to challenges faced by the child, disability impacts the entire family unit. The assistance and care (both formal and informal) of a child with disability often results in parents and/or carers having reduced income, increased expenses, poorer emotional and physical wellbeing and strained relationships.⁴ Significant evidence has supported the effectiveness of early intervention for children with developmental disabilities.⁴
Across the life span, having a disability is associated with poorer health behaviours and adverse health outcomes5. Further, disability is associated with poorer social engagement and education. These outcomes could be related directly to the disability itself or a result of limited access (due to an individual’s disability) to appropriate information, services and support that foster wellbeing. People with disability have higher rates of mental illness, psychological distress, arthritis, smoking and a range of other health conditions than the general population.⁵
Given the challenges and needs of children with disability and their families, understanding the proportion of children with disability in particular geographical regions can assist policy makers and service providers in decision making to improve outcomes.

Title: Mental health — Australian Child and Youth Wellbeing Atlas

Indicator:
Mental health related hospitalisations for selected age group
Policy context:
A mental illness is a clinically diagnosable disorder that impairs an individuals’ cognitive, emotional and/or social abilities.¹ There are various types and severities of mental illnesses.
In a large-scale survey conducted in 2015, 13.9% of Australian children aged between 4 and 17 were assessed as having had a mental health disorder in the last 12 months.² The most common mental illnesses in children and adolescents were ADHD, anxiety disorders, major depressive disorder and conduct disorders.² These illnesses place a significant personal burden on individuals in this age group as well as the health system in general. The rates of mental illness in this age group should also be understood as an important indicator of future health and demand for services because various studies have shown that many adults with mental illnesses had their first onset of symptoms in childhood.
Mental health is related to a range of social factors such as economic disadvantage, poor housing, a lack of social support and access to health services.² As such, understanding the proportion of mental illness in young people by geographical area can be utilised to ensure policy and services are meeting the needs of young people in their communities. Examining proportions of mental illness alongside other demographic factors (e.g. unemployment) for certain geographic areas can help policy makers and providers understand where mental illness in young people could be better addressed.

Births to mothers with a mental illness diagnosis
Policy context:
A mental illness is a clinically diagnosable disorder that impairs an individuals’ cognitive, emotional and/or social abilities.¹ There are various types and severities of mental illnesses. It is estimated that around half of the Australian adult population will experience a mental illness in their lifetime and that approximately 1 in 5 adults have experienced a mental illness in the last 12 months.²
The most common mental illnesses experienced by mothers in this period are major depression, bipolar disorder and anxiety disorders.³ Children whose mothers have a perinatal mental health disorder (22 completed weeks of gestation to 1 year after birth) are at increased risk of developmental and psychological disturbances such as; depression and anxiety, emotional regulation problems, poorer social behaviour, insecure attachment, increased behaviour problems and impaired physical and cognitive development.³ʼ⁴ This likely results from a combination of genetic inheritance and environmental risk factors associated with a parent having a mental illness.⁵ʼ⁶
In addition to biological and psychological factors, mental health is related to a range of social factors such as economic disadvantage, poor housing, a lack of social support and access to health services.² Therefore, understanding the number of births to mothers with a mental illness in particular geographic regions, especially when examined alongside information about social factors, can inform policy to help improve perinatal mental health care.

Indicator:
Substance abuse disorder related hospitalisations for selected age group
Policy context:
A substance abuse disorder involves a pattern of substance use that results in an impairment or distress in daily activities.¹ For example, individuals with a substance abuse disorder commonly have repeatedly failed to stop using the substance, used more than planned, experienced craving for or withdrawal from the substance and/or, continued to use a substance despite its negative impact on their lives.¹
‘Substance’ can refer to: alcohol, caffeine, cannabis, hallucinogens, inhalants, opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, anxiolytics, stimulants, tobacco, and other or unknown substances.¹ Alcohol, tobacco and cannabis are the substances most frequently used by young people.²
Substance abuse disorders are among the most common mental health disorders experienced by young people in Australia and the fourth highest contributor to the burden of disease in this age group.³ʼ⁴
There is evidence that substance abuse can be reduced by addressing relevant risk factors such as early exposure to a substance or poor mental health, and by increasing protective factors such as early patterns of healthy behaviours.⁵ʼ⁶
Being able to understand rates of substance abuse disorder within geographical area therefore has the advantage of allowing policy makers and service providers to make informed choices when working to improve outcomes.
Using this data alongside other social information (such as unemployment and income) could be especially important as a range of social factors are risk factors associated with alcohol and drug abuse.⁶

Emergency Department presentations that were mental health related in children and young people
Policy context:
Mental health disorders are the most common chronic conditions experienced by young people in the developed world and are a significant burden to public health in Australia.¹ʼ² Additionally, many mental health disorders of adulthood have their onset in childhood or adolescence.³
In recent years, the number of young people presenting to emergency departments with mental health conditions has steadily increased.⁴ The most common nature of presentation is for intentional self-harm.⁴ Other common presentations are for substance abuse, and mood, behavioural, or emotional disorders.⁴
Understanding the proportion of paediatric presentations to ED that are because of mental health has important implications for policy and service delivery.⁴ Geographic statistics can provide insight into where hospitals need to be better equipped to effectively deal with mental health presentations and where non-hospital services have not been sufficient to meet the needs of individuals experiencing mental health conditions. They can also indicate where mental health and health service education may be lacking, leading individuals to present to an emergency department rather than an alternative service that may be better suited to their needs.
Understanding the prevalence of mental health emergency department presentations in young people is therefore useful for informing effective policy to improve the outcomes of young people across the state.

Policy context:
Mental health disorders are the most common chronic conditions experienced by young people in the developed world and are a significant burden to public health in Australia.¹ʼ² In recent years, the number of young people presenting to emergency departments with mental health conditions has steadily increased.³ The most common nature of presentation is for deliberate self-harm.³
Deliberate self-harm refers to an intentional act of causing physical injury to oneself, without the intention for the injury to cause death.⁴ However, deliberate self-harm can lead to accidental fatality.⁴ Presentations to Emergency Departments for deliberate self-harm may indicate more life-threatening forms of self-injury. There is also an increased risk of completed suicide following presentation to hospital for deliberate self-harm.⁵
Understanding the proportion of paediatric presentations to ED that are because of deliberate self-harm has important implications for policy and service delivery.³ Geographic statistics can provide insight into where outpatient mental health services may need to focus prevention and intervention efforts to meet the needs of individuals experiencing acute mental illness, particularly around the prevention of suicide.
Understanding the prevalence of deliberate self-harm emergency department presentations in young people is therefore useful for informing effective policy to improve the outcomes of young people across the state.

Title: Mental health — Australian Child and Youth Wellbeing Atlas

Indicator:
Mental health related hospitalisations for selected age group
Policy context:
A mental illness is a clinically diagnosable disorder that impairs an individuals’ cognitive, emotional and/or social abilities.¹ There are various types and severities of mental illnesses.
In a large-scale survey conducted in 2015, 13.9% of Australian children aged between 4 and 17 were assessed as having had a mental health disorder in the last 12 months.² The most common mental illnesses in children and adolescents were ADHD, anxiety disorders, major depressive disorder and conduct disorders.² These illnesses place a significant personal burden on individuals in this age group as well as the health system in general. The rates of mental illness in this age group should also be understood as an important indicator of future health and demand for services because various studies have shown that many adults with mental illnesses had their first onset of symptoms in childhood.
Mental health is related to a range of social factors such as economic disadvantage, poor housing, a lack of social support and access to health services.² As such, understanding the proportion of mental illness in young people by geographical area can be utilised to ensure policy and services are meeting the needs of young people in their communities. Examining proportions of mental illness alongside other demographic factors (e.g. unemployment) for certain geographic areas can help policy makers and providers understand where mental illness in young people could be better addressed.

Indicator:
Births to mothers with a mental illness diagnosis
Policy context:
A mental illness is a clinically diagnosable disorder that impairs an individuals’ cognitive, emotional and/or social abilities.¹ There are various types and severities of mental illnesses. It is estimated that around half of the Australian adult population will experience a mental illness in their lifetime and that approximately 1 in 5 adults have experienced a mental illness in the last 12 months.²
The most common mental illnesses experienced by mothers in this period are major depression, bipolar disorder and anxiety disorders.³ Children whose mothers have a perinatal mental health disorder (22 completed weeks of gestation to 1 year after birth) are at increased risk of developmental and psychological disturbances such as; depression and anxiety, emotional regulation problems, poorer social behaviour, insecure attachment, increased behaviour problems and impaired physical and cognitive development.³ʼ⁴ This likely results from a combination of genetic inheritance and environmental risk factors associated with a parent having a mental illness.⁵ʼ⁶
In addition to biological and psychological factors, mental health is related to a range of social factors such as economic disadvantage, poor housing, a lack of social support and access to health services.² Therefore, understanding the number of births to mothers with a mental illness in particular geographic regions, especially when examined alongside information about social factors, can inform policy to help improve perinatal mental health care.

Title: Early Development — Australian Child and Youth Wellbeing Atlas

Indicator:
Children 'developmentally vulnerable' or 'at-risk' on selected domain
Policy context:
The Australian Early Development Census (AEDC) is a national measure of early childhood development, collected for children commencing their first year of compulsory education (Pre-Primary in Western Australia).¹ Since 2009, the AEDC has been collected every three years across public, private, and independent schools in Australia.¹ʼ²
All children included in the AEDC are scored on five domains of development that are associated with predictors of good social, health and educational outcomes into adulthood.¹
These domains are
Physical health and wellbeing
Social competence
Emotional maturity
Language and cognitive skills
Communication skills and general knowledge.¹ʼ²
These domains of development are considered to provide a snapshot of a child’s level of school readiness, which is an important predictor of ongoing educational and occupational achievement.³ʼ⁴
Children are classified as ‘developmentally vulnerable’ on a domain if they score below the 10th percentile (based on national data), and ‘developmentally at risk’ on a domain if they score between the 11ᵗʰ and 25ᵗʰ percentile.¹  Hence ‘developmentally vulnerable or at risk’ comprises children who scored on the 25ᵗʰ percentile or below.
Fostering the different areas of early development connected to each of the five domains may require differing policies and services. The AEDC data on developmental vulnerability across each of the five domains can therefore be used as an indicator of the wellbeing of children in a given region and used to inform policy and planning to improve health and education outcomes.¹ʼ²

Indicator:
Children attending preschool program for 15 hours or more
Policy context:
Educational institutions for children aged 0-4 years are structured, play-based learning programs delivered by degree-qualified teachers for children in the years leading up to full-time schooling.¹
Preschool participation increases school readiness, which is associated with better ongoing educational attainment and achievement as well as life outcomes more generally.²⁻⁴
Children from disadvantaged families are less likely to be enrolled in preschool and tend to have lower attendance rates.⁵
Given the association between educational attainment and health outcomes across the lifespan, preschool participation levels can be used as an early indicator of child development and vulnerability to poor health outcomes.
Therefore, it can be utilised by policy makers to reveal where children may be at risk of having poorer outcomes and to allocate resources and services to areas where they may be required to ensure healthy child development.

Infant mortality refers to the number of deaths of infants (aged 0-1) in any given year per 1000 live births.¹ The most common causes of death before one year of age are conditions originating in the perinatal period and congenital conditions.² Other common causes of death in this period are Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, injury and accidental threats to breathing.²
Known risks associated with incidence of infant mortality include social and economic factors such as low income, unemployment, teenage motherhood, and mother’s education.³ʼ⁴ As such, infant mortality can be used as an indicator of the general wellbeing of a population and as an indicator of the accessibility, quality, and performance of the health system in maternal and perinatal health.⁵
As infant mortality is associated with both social and economic factors and healthcare quality and access it can be used by policy makers and health providers to give insight into the health of mothers and babies as well as the broader population in a region. Therefore, combined with other factors, infant mortality can be used to inform policy, strategy and intervention to support child health and development.

Indicator:
Child mortality (all causes)
Policy context:
Child mortality refers to the number of deaths of children in any given year per 100,000 population. The primary causes of mortality vary between different stages of childhood.
The majority of deaths between the ages of 0 and 5 years of age occur within the first year of life, with the highest risk of death being in the first month.⁴ The main causes of death between the ages of 0 and 5 years include conditions originating in the perinatal period, congenital diseases, Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, injury related to traffic accidents, drowning and accidental threats to breathing, and cancer.¹
In addition to the personal consequences of the death of a child on individuals in Australian communities, child mortality can be used as an indicator of the health of a population due to its association with a range of social and economic factors.²ʼ⁴ʼ⁵
Child mortality is associated with social and economic disadvantage, access to health care, nutrition, hygiene, sanitation, maternal education, unemployment, community awareness of child mortality risk factors, and immunisation programs.²ʼ⁴ʼ⁵
Child mortality is an important indicator for health providers and policy makers to inform policy, strategy, and intervention, providing insight into the health of young children as well as the broader population.¹ The importance of child mortality statistics is amplified by the knowledge that many of the causes of death in this period, such as traffic accidents or accidental drowning, are preventable.¹

Title: Demographic and Social — Australian Child and Youth Wellbeing Atlas

Indicator:
Households with total income < $1000 per week
Policy context:
Low income households are households that are in the lowest 18% of equivalised disposable household income (EDHI).¹  EDHI refers to the amount of money, after tax and other deductions, which is available; divided by the number of household members converted to equivalised adults (weighted according to age).¹ It is used as an indicator of the economic resources available to a household.¹
Low income is an important social determinant of health and wellbeing, and a good indicator of disadvantage (a significant risk factor for poorer health outcomes throughout the lifespan).²⁻⁴ Low income acts as a health determinant because it can negatively impact a range of living and working conditions like housing standards, access to quality healthcare, availability of nutritious food, educational attainment, exposure to stress and options for healthy pursuits such as sports clubs.⁴⁻⁶ Further, children from low income households can have lower school readiness (associated with poorer health outcomes across the lifespan) due to financial stress impacting family relationships and reduced family ability to invest in advantageous experiences such as preschool or playgroups.⁷
Further, low income households tend to be concentrated in particular suburbs and neighbourhoods.⁸ The accumulation of people living with fewer financial resources in particular geographical areas can further exacerbate disadvantage as these areas tend to have less community resources, reduced neighbourhood safety, poorer services (e.g. education, health care, public transport) and lower social cohesion.⁸
Considering the relationship between child development and disadvantage, understanding which areas of the state have a greater proportion of low income households can guide policy and strategy to invest in the improvement of the living conditions of children to improve public health across the lifespan.⁶

Indicator:
Private dwellings with Internet connection
Policy context:
Private dwellings are classified as having no internet connection if no individual in the house has access to the internet though any device (including a mobile or smart phone).¹ Low income households and those located in non-metropolitan or regional areas are less likely to have access to the internet.¹
In contemporary society having access to the internet means greater access to social connections as well as material and social resources. This includes access to health services and health information as well as other resources and social connections that contribute to health and wellbeing (such as education institutions and support networks).¹ʼ² As such, not having an internet connection in the home is considered an indicator of disadvantage because it signals a lack of resources or ability to participate fully in society.¹ʼ²
Disadvantage is a significant risk factor for poorer health outcomes for children both in early development and throughout the lifespan.³ʼ⁴ Further, as the internet functions as a primary source of information and social connection, parents who do not have internet connection may not.
In light of the relationship between child development and disadvantage, understanding which areas have a greater proportion of households experiencing disadvantage, through indicators such as internet connection, can guide policy and strategy to ensure areas that may require additional support to foster child development receive it.

Indicator:
Unemployed persons for selected age group
Policy context:
Individuals are classified as unemployed if they have not worked more than one hour in the reference week; have actively looked for work in the past 4 weeks; and, are available to start work in the reference week.¹ People who are unemployed are less likely to have an adequate income and more likely to have poor health and wellbeing outcomes and higher stress.²𝄒³
Parental unemployment (and the related consequences for parent health) is also associated with poorer health outcomes for children such as higher rates of chronic illness, psychosomatic symptoms, and psychological problems throughout their lifespan.⁴⁻⁶
Unemployment is also considered an indicator of household disadvantage which is a significant risk factor for poorer health outcomes for children both in development and throughout the lifespan.⁷𝄒⁸
There are a range of socioeconomic factors that connect disadvantage to poorer health outcomes.⁸ These include direct causes such as exposure to more pollution or poor housing, as well as more indirect pathways such as higher social acceptability of poor health behaviours including smoking, fast food consumption or violence; lower educational attainment; and greater exposure to stressors.⁹𝄒¹⁰
Further, disadvantage tends to be concentrated in particular suburbs and neighbourhoods.¹¹ The accumulation of people living with fewer resources in particular geographical areas can further exacerbate disadvantage as these areas tend to have less community resources, reduced neighbourhood safety, poorer services (e.g. education, health care, public transport) and lower social cohesion.¹¹
As unemployment is related to parent and child health it is an important factor to consider in relation to child development. Rates of unemployment can inform policy makers and services of areas where lifestyle factors and disadvantage may be having an adverse impact on child development and assist them to distribute resources appropriately.

Indicator:
Children who don't speak English well or not at all, by selected age group
Policy context:
Households are classified as having a main language other than English spoken at home if the primary language of communication between residents and regular visitors is one other than English (including sign language).¹ Having a main language other than English spoken at home can be an indicator of lower English proficiency and understanding.¹
In Australia, having low English proficiency and understanding can limit a person’s ability to effectively participate in society (including accessing support, social networks, and services), which affects all members of the household and is a social determinant of health.¹𝄒²
Further, people who speak a main language other than English can be reluctant to access health services due to cultural difference, experiences or perceptions of discrimination and concerns about misunderstanding, leading to disparities in health.³
Children from culturally and linguistically diverse households can also have lower school readiness than their peers because of lower English proficiency in learning or conversation and increased vulnerability to bullying.⁴ School readiness is extremely important due to its association with ongoing academic achievement and life outcomes.⁴
Therefore, geographical areas that have a high proportion of households speaking a main language other than English in the home can be understood as vulnerable to having poorer child development outcomes.
Accordingly, information about home language statistics and child development can be used to help policy makers understand where extra resources may be required to ensure children from culturally and linguistically diverse households have appropriate resources and services to support good health and development.

Title: Demographic and Social — Australian Child and Youth Wellbeing Atlas

Indicator:
Households with total income < $1000 per week
Policy context:
Low income households are households that are in the lowest 18% of equivalised disposable household income (EDHI).¹  EDHI refers to the amount of money, after tax and other deductions, which is available; divided by the number of household members converted to equivalised adults (weighted according to age).¹ It is used as an indicator of the economic resources available to a household.¹
Low income is an important social determinant of health and wellbeing, and a good indicator of disadvantage (a significant risk factor for poorer health outcomes throughout the lifespan).²⁻⁴ Low income acts as a health determinant because it can negatively impact a range of living and working conditions like housing standards, access to quality healthcare, availability of nutritious food, educational attainment, exposure to stress and options for healthy pursuits such as sports clubs.⁴⁻⁶ Further, children from low income households can have lower school readiness (associated with poorer health outcomes across the lifespan) due to financial stress impacting family relationships and reduced family ability to invest in advantageous experiences such as preschool or playgroups.⁷
Further, low income households tend to be concentrated in particular suburbs and neighbourhoods.⁸ The accumulation of people living with fewer financial resources in particular geographical areas can further exacerbate disadvantage as these areas tend to have less community resources, reduced neighbourhood safety, poorer services (e.g. education, health care, public transport) and lower social cohesion.⁸
Considering the relationship between child development and disadvantage, understanding which areas of the state have a greater proportion of low income households can guide policy and strategy to invest in the improvement of the living conditions of children to improve public health across the lifespan.⁶

Indicator:
Private dwellings with Internet connection
Policy context:
Private dwellings are classified as having no internet connection if no individual in the house has access to the internet though any device (including a mobile or smart phone).¹ Low income households and those located in non-metropolitan or regional areas are less likely to have access to the internet.¹
In contemporary society having access to the internet means greater access to social connections as well as material and social resources. This includes access to health services and health information as well as other resources and social connections that contribute to health and wellbeing (such as education institutions and support networks).¹ʼ² As such, not having an internet connection in the home is considered an indicator of disadvantage because it signals a lack of resources or ability to participate fully in society.¹ʼ²
Disadvantage is a significant risk factor for poorer health outcomes for children both in early development and throughout the lifespan.³ʼ⁴ Further, as the internet functions as a primary source of information and social connection, parents who do not have internet connection may not.
In light of the relationship between child development and disadvantage, understanding which areas have a greater proportion of households experiencing disadvantage, through indicators such as internet connection, can guide policy and strategy to ensure areas that may require additional support to foster child development receive it.

Indicator:
Unemployed persons for selected age group
Policy context:
Individuals are classified as unemployed if they have not worked more than one hour in the reference week; have actively looked for work in the past 4 weeks; and, are available to start work in the reference week.¹ People who are unemployed are less likely to have an adequate income and more likely to have poor health and wellbeing outcomes and higher stress.²𝄒³
Parental unemployment (and the related consequences for parent health) is also associated with poorer health outcomes for children such as higher rates of chronic illness, psychosomatic symptoms, and psychological problems throughout their lifespan.⁴⁻⁶
Unemployment is also considered an indicator of household disadvantage which is a significant risk factor for poorer health outcomes for children both in development and throughout the lifespan.⁷𝄒⁸
There are a range of socioeconomic factors that connect disadvantage to poorer health outcomes.⁸ These include direct causes such as exposure to more pollution or poor housing, as well as more indirect pathways such as higher social acceptability of poor health behaviours including smoking, fast food consumption or violence; lower educational attainment; and greater exposure to stressors.⁹𝄒¹⁰
Further, disadvantage tends to be concentrated in particular suburbs and neighbourhoods.¹¹ The accumulation of people living with fewer resources in particular geographical areas can further exacerbate disadvantage as these areas tend to have less community resources, reduced neighbourhood safety, poorer services (e.g. education, health care, public transport) and lower social cohesion.¹¹
As unemployment is related to parent and child health it is an important factor to consider in relation to child development. Rates of unemployment can inform policy makers and services of areas where lifestyle factors and disadvantage may be having an adverse impact on child development and assist them to distribute resources appropriately.

Indicator:
Children who don't speak English well or not at all, by selected age group
Policy context:
Households are classified as having a main language other than English spoken at home if the primary language of communication between residents and regular visitors is one other than English (including sign language).¹ Having a main language other than English spoken at home can be an indicator of lower English proficiency and understanding.¹
In Australia, having low English proficiency and understanding can limit a person’s ability to effectively participate in society (including accessing support, social networks, and services), which affects all members of the household and is a social determinant of health.¹𝄒²
Further, people who speak a main language other than English can be reluctant to access health services due to cultural difference, experiences or perceptions of discrimination and concerns about misunderstanding, leading to disparities in health.³
Children from culturally and linguistically diverse households can also have lower school readiness than their peers because of lower English proficiency in learning or conversation and increased vulnerability to bullying.⁴ School readiness is extremely important due to its association with ongoing academic achievement and life outcomes.⁴
Therefore, geographical areas that have a high proportion of households speaking a main language other than English in the home can be understood as vulnerable to having poorer child development outcomes.
Accordingly, information about home language statistics and child development can be used to help policy makers understand where extra resources may be required to ensure children from culturally and linguistically diverse households have appropriate resources and services to support good health and development.

Rate of Emergency Department presentations in children/young people
Policy Context:
Emergency department presentations provide information about who received care in Australia’s public and private hospital emergency departments. There are a range of possible reasons that some regions may have a greater proportion of children and young people presenting to an emergency department than others.
Areas where primary health services are less accessible (due to cost, geographic proximity, lack of awareness, or attitudinal factors) tend to have greater proportions of emergency department presentations due to higher rates of people seeking help at hospital for problems that would ideally be addressed in a primary care setting.¹
Therefore, proportions of hospital presentations, in combination with other indicators, can be used to help policy makers understand which regions may require greater access to primary services to provide sufficient and appropriate healthcare to children and young people.

Policy Context:
Ngala is an organisation that supports families, parents and carers to navigate parenting children (from before pregnancy up to having children 18 years of age) through a range of services across Western Australia.¹
Ngala’s parenting helpline is its main point of contact for parents and carers with parenting concerns. It functions both to provide free parenting advice and support and to refer families and individuals on to other relevant resources and services.¹
Parents may require assistance to gain reliable information about parenting and navigate the challenges it involves. If an area has a high number of calls this may indicate a higher level of need for parenting support, a lack of sufficient services and resources to provide this support or a combination of both these things.

Ngala’s parenting helpline is its main point of contact for parents and carers with parenting concerns. It functions both to provide free parenting advice and support and to refer families and individuals on to other relevant resources and services.¹
The support parents require varies at different stages of their children’s lives. For example, parents of infants could require advice about sleep and feeding whereas parents of teenagers may be looking for assistance with relationships, behaviour management and education.
The average age of children at the time calls were made to Ngala can therefore provide insight into the type of support parents are currently seeking in different geographical areas.

Ngala’s parenting helpline is its main point of contact for parents and carers with parenting concerns. It functions both to provide free parenting advice and support and to refer families and individuals on to other relevant resources and services.¹
Based on the assumption that the amount of time a caller requires is associated with the amount of assistance needed, the length of calls to the Ngala helpline can be used as an indicator of the complexity of issues callers are presenting with and their level of need. Therefore, combined with other indicators, the average length of calls to Ngala for particular areas can be used to indicate the level of parenting assistance required in particular regions.

Prior moving averages combine a sequence of 3 or 5 years of data prior to, and including, the selected year. The series are presented as overlapping sequences until the most recent year is included. Moving averages make it possible to combine more years of data to maximize sample size at each point while maintaining data confidentiality.
Notes:
The EDDC captures data relating to services provided to patients within public hospital emergency departments, contracted health entities and emergency services provided in smaller hospitals without a designated ED. The collection excludes episodes of non-admitted patient care provided in outpatient clinics or hospital inpatient departments.
Indicator:
Number of logged calls to Ngala parenting helpline service
Policy Context:
Ngala is an organisation that supports families, parents and carers to navigate parenting children (from before pregnancy up to having children 18 years of age) through a range of services across Western Australia.¹
Ngala’s parenting helpline is its main point of contact for parents and carers with parenting concerns. It functions both to provide free parenting advice and support and to refer families and individuals on to other relevant resources and services.¹
Parents may require assistance to gain reliable information about parenting and navigate the challenges it involves. If an area has a high number of calls this may indicate a higher level of need for parenting support, a lack of sufficient services and resources to provide this support or a combination of both these things.

Policy Context:
Ngala is an organisation that supports families, parents and carers to navigate parenting children (from before pregnancy up to having children 18 years of age) through a range of services across Western Australia.¹
Ngala’s parenting helpline is its main point of contact for parents and carers with parenting concerns. It functions both to provide free parenting advice and support and to refer families and individuals on to other relevant resources and services.¹
The support parents require varies at different stages of their children’s lives. For example, parents of infants could require advice about sleep and feeding whereas parents of teenagers may be looking for assistance with relationships, behaviour management and education.
The average age of children at the time calls were made to Ngala can therefore provide insight into the type of support parents are currently seeking in different geographical areas.

Service Data: Average call length to Ngala helpline service
Policy Context:
Ngala is an organisation that supports families, parents and carers to navigate parenting children (from before pregnancy up to having children 18 years of age) through a range of services across Western Australia.¹
Ngala’s parenting helpline is its main point of contact for parents and carers with parenting concerns. It functions both to provide free parenting advice and support and to refer families and individuals on to other relevant resources and services.¹
Based on the assumption that the amount of time a caller requires is associated with the amount of assistance needed, the length of calls to the Ngala helpline can be used as an indicator of the complexity of issues callers are presenting with and their level of need. Therefore, combined with other indicators, the average length of calls to Ngala for particular areas can be used to indicate the level of parenting assistance required in particular regions.

Data confidentiality:
Counting rules have been applied to certain reporting categories (typically those known to have been prone to over-recording of offences historically) in order to provide a more accurate picture of crime volumes and trends. Counting rules are applied historically to ensure comparability.
Notes:
Distinct counts of selected offences involve an offender, where the offence occurred between 01 January 2005 and 31 December 2018 inclusive, in the associated Local Government Area, SA3 Area and SA2 Area. As such, a single offence involving multiple offenders will be counted once against the relevant categories
Location data is recorded for all offences. However, if the location is unable to be identified using WA Police Force geographical mapping tables, the offence will not appear in these figures. This is approximately 0.0004% of offences.

Title: ACYWA logo competition acknowledgement — Australian Child and Youth Wellbeing Atlas

As part of the much-anticipated launch of the Australian Child and Youth Wellbeing Atlas (ACYWA), children and youth across the nation were invited to participate in a logo design competition in June 2023. They were asked to create an original artwork that embodied the essence of ACYWA's mission: to enhance the wellbeing, health and learning of Australia's children and young individuals.
It was Rebekah Hendy's evocative, uplifting design that struck a chord with the judges. In a remarkable display of creativity, she utilised plants, foliage and leaves to symbolise the bright future ACYWA envisions for each child and youth in Australia across six wellbeing domains.
Inspired by Rebekah’s design, the final ACYWA logo showcases an abstract tree taking root in the earth, with leaf-like shapes representing every state and territory in Australia.
Beneath the canopy, the silhouette of three people represents two central themes: the imperative role that individuals and families hold in crafting Australia's identity, alongside ACYWA's core focus on person-centric data, interconnectedness, and community.
Drawn from nature's palette, the final logo employs hues of green, blue, and brown to mirror Australia's rich biodiversity and picturesque landscapes. Reds and ochres - reminiscent of Aboriginal sacred colours - are used in recognition and respect of Traditional Custodians of the land. The growth of the tree emphasises ACYWA's commitment to improving the welfare of Australia's children and youth, through the provision of pertinent, accessible and beneficial information and resources.
ACYWA extends heartfelt gratitude towards Rebekah for her artistic vision, which resonates profoundly in ACYWA’s quest to improve the lives of children and young people across Australia.
In the spirit of reconciliation we acknowledge the Traditional Custodians of country throughout Australia and their connections to land, sea and community.

Title: Australian Child and Youth Wellbeing Atlas

data asset that maps information on children and young people aged 0 to 24 in
communities across Australia. This enables the visualisation, analysis, and
monitoring of health and wellbeing metrics for children and young people.

This unique new data asset empowers researchers, non-government, state and federal organisations to identify priorities for child health and wellbeing research and initiatives in meaningful and cost-effective ways.
The Australian Child and Youth Wellbeing Atlas - ACYWA accelerates the national access to and use of spatial data to understand inequities and improve the wellbeing, health and development of children and young people.
By enabling equitable access to this information, the Atlas contributes to the democratisation of data, fostering a more inclusive and informed society.
The Australian Child and Youth Wellbeing Atlas defines children’s health and wellbeing in the context of the evidence-based Nest framework of child and youth wellbeing developed by the Australian Research Alliance for Children and Youth (ARACY), which includes six wellbeing domains:
Deliver a freely accessible nationwide platform featuring geospatial and temporal visualisation of comprehensive child health and wellbeing indicators at local and national levels.
Provide insights into the associations between community-level factors and children's outcomes.
Help guide the development of geographically sensitive policy, which acknowledges the relationships between the spatial patterns of children’s wellbeing outcomes, and the provision of services in an area.
Identify gaps, priorities, and research opportunities, aiding policy and investment decisions for tangible health improvements.
Expand a national network of experts in child and youth wellbeing and data monitoring, including policymakers, researchers, clinicians, and community representatives.
A partnership that breaks through system barriers:
The Australian Child and Youth Wellbeing Atlas is an exciting systemic initiative that brings together leading expertise across Australia’s child and youth research, advocacy, policy and practice fields.
The partnership has naturally evolved, driven by an exceptional motivation to collaborate and fulfill a common mission. This mission aims to revolutionise the access and utilisation of data to enhance children's health, development, and wellbeing, ultimately striving for equitable outcomes for all Australian children.

In the Atlas prototype, data has not yet been disaggregated for First Nations children and young people. This decision arises from our profound awareness of the commonly inadequate representation of wellbeing outcomes concerning First Nations children and young people.
Prior to incorporating data pertaining to First Nations children and young people, we intend to establish a robust Indigenous Data Governance structure through our Indigenous Data Sovereignty Working Group. This framework will provide guidance to ensure the accurate inclusion and meaningful application of data related to First Nations children and young people.
In the Atlas prototype, data has not been disaggregated by gender identity. It only provides a breakdown based on the traditional categories of female and male.
We are profoundly aware that many young people identify with a wide spectrum of gender-diverse identities, which go beyond the binary concept of female and male. These identities include terms such as non-binary, gender fluid, gender questioning, agender, and others that best represent their gender identity.
The process of disaggregating data by these gender identities presents several challenges. Often, existing data collection methods do not yet capture this information, and even when they do, privacy concerns may necessitate data suppression due to small sample sizes or data quality issues.
The ACYWA project is committed to working on finding ways to overcome these obstacles. Our objective is to directly engage with trans and gender-diverse youth to understand their preferences regarding how their data should be represented.
An increasing body of research into wellbeing outcomes of gender-diverse people has revealed that gender-diverse children and youth face notably more challenges across multiple aspects of wellbeing, performing comparatively worse than other vulnerable groups across specific measures.¹
